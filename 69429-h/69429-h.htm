<p class="drop-cap">“THE shining mountains,” said Gregory Compton softly,
throwing back his head, his eyes travelling along the
hard bright outlines above the high valley in which his
ranch lay. “The shining mountains. That is what the Indians
called them before the white man came.”</p>

<p>His wife yawned frankly. “Pity they don’t shine
inside as well as out—what we’ve got of ’em.”</p>

<p>“Who knows? Who knows?”</p>

<p>“We don’t. That’s the trouble.”</p>

<p>But although she spoke tartly, she nestled into his arm,
for she was not unamiable, she had been married but sixteen
months, and she was still fond of her husband “in a
way”; moreover, although she cherished resentments open
and secret, she never forgot that she had won a prize “as
men go.” Many girls in Butte<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a> had wanted to marry Gregory
Compton, not only because he had inherited a ranch of
eleven hundred and sixty acres, but because, comprehensively,
he was superior to the other young men of his class.
He had graduated from the High School before he was
sixteen; then after three years’ work on the ranch under
his unimaginative father, he had announced his intention
of leaving the State unless permitted to attend the School
of Mines in Butte. The old man, who by this time had
taken note of the formation of his son’s jaw, gave his consent
rather than lose the last of his children; and for two
years and a semester Gregory had been the most brilliant
figure in the School of Mines.</p>

<p>“Old Man Compton,” who had stampeded from his
small farm in northern New York in the sixties to meet<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[2]</span>
with little success in the mines, but more as a rancher, had
been as typical a hayseed as ever punctuated politics with
tobacco juice in front of a corner grocery-store, but had
promised his wife on her death-bed that their son should
have “schooling.” Mrs. Compton, who had arrived in
Montana soon after the log house was built, was a large,
dark, silent woman, whom none of her distant neighbours
had ever claimed to know. It was currently believed in
the New York village whence she came that in the early
days of the eighteenth century the sturdy Verrooy stock
had been abruptly crossed by the tribe of the Oneida. Ancient
history in a new country is necessarily enveloped in
mist, but although the children she had lost had been fair
and nondescript like their father, her youngest, and her
only son, possessed certain characteristics of the higher
type of Indian. He was tall and lightly built, graceful,
supple, swift of foot, with the soft tread of the panther;
and although his skin was no darker than that of the average
brunette, it acquired significance from the intense
blackness of his hair, the thin aquiline nose, the long, narrow
eyes, the severe and stolid dignity of expression even
in his earlier years.</p>

<p>He had seemed to the girls of the only class he knew in
Butte an even more romantic figure than the heroes of
their magazine fiction, particularly as he took no notice of
them until he met Ida Hook at a picnic and surrendered
his heart.</p>

<p>Ida, forced by her thrifty mother to accept employment
with a fashionable dressmaker, and consumed with envy
of the “West Siders” whose measurements she took, did
not hesitate longer than feminine prudence dictated. Before
she gave her hair its nightly brushing her bold unpedantic
hand had covered several sheets of pink note-paper
with the legend, “Mrs. Gregory Compton,” the while she
assured herself there was “no sweller name on West
Broadway.” To do her justice, she also thrilled with
young passion, for more than her vanity had responded
to the sombre determined attentions of the man who had
been the indifferent hero of so many maiden dreams. Although
she longed to be a Copper Queen, she was too
young to be altogether hard; and, now that her hour was
come, every soft enchantment of her sex awoke to bind
and blind her mate.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[3]</span>Gregory Compton’s indifference to women had been
more pretended than real, although an occasional wild
night on The Flat had interested him far more than picnics
and dances where the girls used no better grammar
than the “sporting women” and were far less amusing. He
went to this picnic to please his old school friend, Mark
Blake, and because Nine Mile Cañon had looked very
green and alluring after the June rains when he had ridden
through it alone the day before. The moment he stood
before Ida Hook, staring into the baffling limpid eyes,
about which heavy black lashes rose and fell and met and
tangled and shot apart in a series of bedevilling manœuvres,
he believed himself to be possessed by that intimate
soul-seeking desire that nothing but marriage can satisfy.
He kept persistently at her side, his man’s instinct prompting
the little attentions women value less than they demand.
He also took more trouble to interest her verbally
than was normal in one whom nature had prompted to
silence, and he never would learn the rudiments of small
talk; but his brain was humming in time with his eager
awakened pulses, and Ida was too excited and exultant to
take note of his words. “It was probably about mines,
anyway,” she confided to her friends, Ruby and Pearl
Miller. “Nobody talks about anything else long in this
old camp.”</p>

<p>Gregory’s infatuation was by no means reduced by the
fact that no less than six young men contended for the
favour of Miss Hook. She was the accredited beauty of
Butte, for even the ladies of the West Side had noticed
and discussed her and hoped that their husbands and
brothers had not. It was true that her large oval blue-grey
eyes, set like Calliope’s, were as shallow as her voice;
but the lids were so broad and white, and the lashes so
silky and oblique, that the critical faculty of man was
drugged, if dimly prescient. Her cheeks were a trifle too
full, her nose of a type unsung in marble; but what of
that when her skin was as white as milk, the colour in
cheek and lips of a clear transparent coral, that rarest
and most seductive of nature’s reds, her little teeth enamelled
like porcelain? And had she not every captivating
trick, from active eyelash to the sudden toss of her small
head on its long round throat, even to the dilating nostril
which made her nose for the moment look patrician and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[4]</span>
thin! Her figure, too, with its boyish hips, thin flexible
waist, and full low bust, which she carried with a fine
upright swing, was made the most of in a collarless blouse,
closely fitting skirt, and narrow dark belt.</p>

<p>Miss Hook, although her expression was often wide-eyed
and innocent, was quite cynically aware of her power over
the passions of men. More than one man of high salary or
recent fortune had tried to “annex” her, as she airily put
it; her self-satisfaction and the ever-present sophistications
of a mining town saving her from anything so gratuitous
as outraged maidenhood.</p>

<p>The predatory male and his promises had never tempted
her, and it was her boast that she had never set foot in
the road houses of The Flat. She had made up her mind
long since to live on the West Side, the fashionable end
of Butte, and was wise enough, to quote her own words,
to know that the straight and narrow was the only direct
route. Ambition, her sleepless desire to be a grand dame
(which she pronounced without any superfluous accent),
was stronger than vanity or her natural love of pleasure.
By the ordinary romantic yearnings of her age and sex
she was unhampered; but when she met Gregory Compton,
she played the woman’s game so admirably the long day
through that she brushed her heavy black hair at night
quite satisfied he would propose when she gave him his
chance. This she withheld for several days, it being both
pleasant and prudent to torment him. He walked home
with her every afternoon from the dressmaking establishment
on North Main Street to her mother’s cottage in East
Granite, to be dismissed at the gate coyly, reluctantly,
indifferently, but always with a glance of startled wonder
from the door.</p>

<p>In the course of the week she gave him to understand
that she should attend the Friday Night dance at Columbia
Gardens, and expected him to escort her. Gregory,
who by this time was reduced to a mere prowling instinct
projected with fatal instantaneity from its napping ego,
was as helpless a victim as if born a fool. He thought
himself the most fortunate of men to receive permission to
sit beside her on the open car during the long ride to the
Gardens, to pay for the greater number of her waltzes, to
be, in short, her beau for the night.</p>

<p>The evening of Friday at Columbia Gardens is Society<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[5]</span>
Night for all respectable Butte, irrespective of class; the
best floor and the airiest hall in Silver Bow County proving
an irresistible incentive to democracy. Moreover,
Butte is a city of few resources, and the Gardens at night
look like fairyland: the immense room is hung with Chinese
lanterns depending from the rafters, the music is the best
in Montana; and the richer the women, the plainer their
frocks. A sort of informal propriety reigns, and millionaire
or clerk pays ten cents for the privilege of dancing
with his lady.</p>

<p>Ida, who had expended five of her hard-earned dollars
on a bottle of imported perfume, wore a white serge suit
cut as well as any in “the grand dame bunch.” After
the sixth waltz she draped her head and shoulders with a
coral-pink scarf and led Gregory, despite the chill of June,
out to his willing fate. The park was infested by other
couples, walking briskly to keep themselves warm, and so
were the picnic grounds where the cottonwoods and Canadian
poplars were being coaxed to grow, now that the
smelters which had reduced the neighbourhood of Butte to
its bones had been removed to Anaconda.</p>

<p>But farther up the cañon no one but themselves adventured,
and here Gregory was permitted to ask this
unique creature, provided with a new and maddening
appeal to the senses, to renounce her kingdom and live on
a ranch.</p>

<p>It was all very crude, even to the blatant moon, which in
the thin brilliant atmosphere of that high altitude swings
low with an almost impudent air of familiarity, and grins
in the face of sentiment. But to Gregory, who was at
heart passionate and romantic, it was a soul-quickening
scene: the blazing golden disk poised on the very crest of
the steep mountain before them, the murmur of water, the
rustling young leaves, the deep-breasted orientally perfumed
woman with the innocent wondering eyes. The
moon chuckled and reminded his exacting mistress, Nature,
that were he given permission to scatter some of his vast
experience instead of the seductive beams that had accumulated
it, this young man with his natural distinction
of mind, and already educated beyond his class, would
enjoy a sudden clarity of vision and perceive the defects
of grammar and breeding in this elemental siren with
nothing but Evian instincts to guide her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[6]</span>But the dutiful old search-light merely whipped up the
ancestral memories in Gregory’s subconscious brain; moreover,
gave him courage. He made love with such passion
and tenderness that Ida, for once elemental, clung to him
so long and so ardently that the grinning moon whisked
off his beam in disgust and retired behind a big black
cloud—which burst shortly afterwards and washed out the
car tracks.</p>

<p>They were married in July, and Mrs. Hook, who had
worked for forty years at tub and ironing-board, moved
over to the dusty cemetery in September, at rest in the
belief not only that her too good-looking daughter was
safely “planted,” but was a supremely happy woman.</p>

<p>Ida’s passion, however, had been merely a gust of youth,
fed by curiosity and gratified ambition; it quickly passed
in the many disappointments of her married life. Gregory
had promised her a servant, but no “hired girl” could be
induced to remain more than a week on the lonely De
Smet Ranch; and Mrs. Compton’s temper finding its only
relief in one-sided quarrels with her Chinese cooks, even
the philosophical Oriental was prone to leave on a moment’s
notice. There were three hired men and three in the
family, after John Oakley came, to cook and “clean up”
for, and there were weeks at a time when Ida was obliged
to rise with the dawn and occupy her large and capable
but daintily manicured hands during many hours of the
day.</p>

<p>Gregory’s personality had kindled what little imagination
she had into an exciting belief in his power over life
and its corollary, the world’s riches. Also, having in mind
the old Indian legend of the great chief who had turned
into shining gold after death and been entombed in what
was now known prosaically as the De Smet Ranch, she had
expected Gregory to “strike it rich” at once.</p>

<p>But although there were several prospect holes on the
ranch, dug by Gregory in past years, he had learned too
much, particularly of geology, during his two years at the
School of Mines to waste any more time digging holes in
the valley or bare portions of the hills. If a ledge existed
it was beneath some tangle of shrub or tree-roots, and he
had no intention of denuding his pasture until he was
prepared to sell his cattle.</p>

<p>He told her this so conclusively a month after they were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[7]</span>
married that she had begged him to raise sugar beets and
build a factory in Butte (which he would be forced to
superintend), reminding him that the only factory in the
State was in the centre of another district and near the
southern border, and that sugar ranged from six to seven
dollars a hundredweight. He merely laughed at this suggestion,
although he was surprised at her sagacity, for,
barring a possible democratic victory, there was room for
two beet-sugar factories in Montana. But he had other
plans, although he gave her no hint of them, and had no
intention of complicating his life with an uncongenial and
exacting business.</p>

<p>By unceasing personal supervision he not only made the
ranch profitable and paid a yearly dividend to his three
aunts, according to the terms of his father’s will, but for
the last two years, after replacing or adding to his stock,
he had deposited a substantial sum in the bank, occasionally
permitting his astute friend, Mark Blake, to turn over
a few hundreds for him on the stock-market. This was
the heyday of the American farmer, and the De Smet
cattle brought the highest prices in the stock-yards for
beef on the hoof. He also raised three crops of alfalfa a
year to insure his live stock against the lean days of a
Rocky Mountain winter. He admitted to Ida that he could
afford to sink a shaft or drive a tunnel in one of his hills,
but added that he should contemplate nothing of the sort
until he had finished his long-delayed course in the School
of Mines, and had thousands to throw away on development
work, miners, and machinery. At this time he saw
no immediate prospect of resuming the studies interrupted
by the death of his father: until John Oakley came, eight
months after his marriage, he knew of no foreman to trust
but himself.</p>

<p>Ida desired the life of the city for other reasons than its
luxuries and distractions. Her fallow brain was shrewd
and observing, although often crude in its deductions.
She soon realised that the longer she lived with her husband
the less she understood him. Like all ignorant women
of any class she cherished certain general estimates of
men, and in her own class it was assumed that the retiring
men were weak and craven, the bold ones necessarily lacking
in that refinement upon which their young lady friends
prided themselves. Ida had found that Gregory, bold as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span>
his wooing had been, and arrogantly masculine as he was
in most things, not only had his shynesses but was far
more refined and sensitive than herself. She was a woman
who prided herself upon her theories, and disliked having
them upset; still more not knowing where she was at, to
use her own spirited vernacular. She began to be haunted
by the fear of making some fatal mistake, living, as she
did, in comparative isolation with him. Not only was her
womanly pride involved, as well as a certain affection
born of habit and possible even to the selfish, rooted as it
is in the animal function of maternity, but she had supreme
faith in his future success and was determined to share it.</p>

<p>She was tired, however, of attempting to fathom the
intense reserves and peculiarities of that silent nature, of
trying to live up to him. She was obliged to resort to
“play-acting”; and, fully aware of her limitations, despite
her keen self-appreciation, was in constant fear that she
would “make a grand mess of it.” Gregory’s eyes could
be very penetrating, and she had discovered that although
he never told funny stories, nor appeared to be particularly
amused at hers, he had his own sense of humour.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">THE young couple stood together in the dawn, the blue
dawn of Montana. The sky was as cold and bright
as polished silver, but the low soft masses of cloud were
blue, the glittering snow on the mountain peaks was blue,
the smooth snow fields on the slopes and in the valley were
blue. Nor was it the blue of azure or of sapphire, but a
deep lovely cool polaric blue, born in the inverted depths
of Montana, and forever dissociated from art.</p>

<p>It was an extramundane scene, and it had drawn Gregory
from his bed since childhood, but to Ida, brought up in a
town, and in one whose horizons until a short while ago
had always been obscured by the poisonous haze of smelters,
and ores roasted in the open, it was “weird.” Novels had
informed her that sunrises were pink, or, at the worst,
grey. There was something mysterious in this cold blue
dawn up in the snow fields, and she hated mystery. But
as it appeared to charm Gregory, she played up to him
when he “dragged” her out to look at it; and she endeavoured
to do so this morning although her own ego was
rampant.</p>

<p>Gregory drew her closer, for she still had the power to
enthrall him at times. He understood the resources within
her shallows as little as she understood his depths, but
although her defects in education and natural equipment
had long since appalled him, he was generally too busy to
think about her, and too masculine to detect that she was
playing a part. This morning, although he automatically
responded to her blandishments, he was merely sensible
of her presence, and his eyes, the long watchful eyes of
the Indian, were concentrated upon the blue light that
poured from the clouds down upon the glistening peaks.
Ida knew that this meant he was getting ready to make an
announcement of some sort, and longed to shake it out of
him. Not daring to outrage his dignity so far, she drew
the fur robe that enveloped them closer and rubbed her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>
soft hair against his chin. It was useless to ask him to
deliver himself until he was “good and ready”, but the
less direct method sometimes prevailed.</p>

<p>Suddenly he came out with it.</p>

<p>“I’ve made up my mind to go back to the School.”</p>

<p>“Back to school—are you loony?”</p>

<p>“The School of Mines, of course. I can enter the Junior
Class where I left off; earlier in fact, as I had finished
the first semester. Besides, I’ve been going over all the
old ground since Oakley came.”</p>

<p>“Is that what’s in all them books.”</p>

<p>“Those, dear.”</p>

<p>“Those. Mining Engineer’s a lot sweller than rancher.”</p>

<p>“Please don’t use that word.”</p>

<p>“Lord, Greg, you’re as particular as if you’d
been brought up in Frisco or Chicago, instead of on a
ranch.”</p>

<p>He laughed outright and pinched her ear. “I use a
good deal of slang myself—only, there are some words
that irritate me—I can hardly explain. It doesn’t matter.”</p>

<p>“Greg,” she asked with sudden suspicion, “why are
you goin’ in for a profession? Have you given up hopes
of strikin’ it rich on this ranch?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I shall never relinquish that dream.” He spoke
so lightly that even had she understood him better she
could not have guessed that the words leapt from what
he believed to be the deepest of his passions. “But what
has that to do with it? If there is gold on the ranch I
shall be more likely to discover it when I know a great
deal more about geology than I do now, and better able
to mine it cheaply after I have learned all I can of milling
and metallurgy at the School. But that is not the point.
There may be nothing here. I wish to graduate into a
profession which not only attracts me more than any other,
but in which the expert can always make a large income.
Ranching doesn’t interest me, and with Oakley to——”</p>

<p>“What woke you up so sudden?”</p>

<p>“I have never been asleep.” But he turned away his
head lest she see the light in his eyes. “Oakley gives me
my chance to get out, that is all. And I am very glad for
your sake——”</p>

<p>“Aw!” Her voice, ringing out with ecstasy, converted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>
the native syllable into music. “It means we are goin’ to
live in Butte!”</p>

<p>“Of course.”</p>

<p>“And I was so took—taken by surprise it never dawned
on me till this minute. Now what do you know about
that?”</p>

<p>“We shall have to be very quiet. I cannot get my
degree until a year from June—a year and seven months
from now. I shall study day and night, and work in the
mines during the winter and summer vacations. I cannot
take you anywhere.”</p>

<p>“Lord knows it can’t be worse’n this. I’ll have my
friends to talk to and there’s always the movin’ picture
shows. Lord, how I’d like to see one.”</p>

<p>“Well, you shall,” he said kindly. “I wrote to Mark
some time ago and asked him to give the tenant of the
cottage notice. As this is the third of the month it must
be empty and ready for us.”</p>

<p>“My goodness gracious!” cried his wife with pardonable
irritation, “but you are a grand one for handin’ out
surprises! Most husbands tell their wives things as they
go along, but you ruminate like a cow and hand over the
cud when you’re good and ready. I’m sick of bein’ treated
as if I was a child.”</p>

<p>“Please don’t look at it in that way. What is the use
of talking about things until one is quite sure they can be
accomplished?”</p>

<p>“That’s half the fun of bein’ married,” said Ida with
one of her flashes of intuition.</p>

<p>“Is it?” Gregory turned this over in his mind, then,
out of his own experience, rejected it as a truism. He
could not think of any subject he would care to discuss
with his wife; or any other woman. But he kissed her
with an unusual sense of compunction. “Perhaps I liked
the idea of surprising you,” he said untruthfully. “You
will be glad to live in Butte once more?”</p>

<p>“You may bet your bottom dollar on that. When do
we go?”</p>

<p>“Tomorrow.”</p>

<p>“<i>Lands</i> sakes! Well, I’m dumb. And breakfast has to
be got if I <i>have</i> had a bomb exploded under me. That
Chink was doin’ fine when I left, but the Lord knows——”</p>

<p>She walked toward the rear of the house, temper in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>
swing of her hips, her head tossed high. Although rejoicing
at the prospect of living in town, she was both
angry and vaguely alarmed, as she so often had been
before, at the unimaginable reserves, the unsuspected
mental activities, and the sudden strikings of this life-partner
who should have done his thinking out loud.</p>

<p>“Lord knows,” thought Mrs. Compton, as she approached
her kitchen, with secret intent to relieve her
feelings by “lambasting” the Mongolian and leaving Oakley
to shift for himself, “it’s like livin’ with that there
Sphinx. I don’t s’pose I’ll ever get used to him, and
maybe the time’ll come when I won’t want to.”</p>

<p class="drop-cap">GREGORY stood for some time longer, leaning on the
gate and waiting for the red fire to rise above the
crystal mountains. He was eager for the morrow, not
only because he longed to be at the foundation stones of
his real life but because his mind craved the precise training,
the logical development, the intoxicating sense of
expansion which he had missed and craved incessantly
during the six years that had elapsed since he had been
torn from the School of Mines. Moreover, his heart was
light; at last he was able to shift the great responsibilities
of his ranch to other shoulders.</p>

<p>Some six months since, his friend, Mark Blake, had
recommended to him a young man who not only had graduated
at the head of his class in the State College of Agriculture,
but had served for two years on one of the State
Experimental Farms. “What he don’t know about scientific
farming, dry, intensive, and all the rest, isn’t worth
shucks, old man,” Blake had written. “He’s as honest
as they come, and hasn’t a red to do the trick himself,
but wants to go on a ranch as foreman, and farm wherever
there’s soil of a reasonable depth. Of course he wants
a share of the profits, but he’s worth it to you, for the
Lord never cut you out for a rancher or farmer, well as
you have done. What you want is to finish your course
and take your degree. Try Oakley out for six months.
There’ll be only one result. You’re a free man.”</p>

<p>The contract had been signed the day before. But Oakley
had been a welcome guest in the small household for
more than practical reasons. Until the night of his advent,
when the two men sat talking until daylight, Gregory
had not realised the mental isolation of his married life.
Like all young men he had idealised the girl who made
the first assault on his preferential passion; but his brain
was too shrewd, keen, practical, in spite of its imaginative
area, to harbor illusions beyond the brief period of novelty.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>
It had taken him but a few weeks to discover that although
his wife had every charm of youth and sex, and was by no
means a fool, their minds moved on different planes, far
apart. He had dreamed of the complete understanding,
the instinctive response, the identity of tastes, in short of
companionship, of the final routing of a sense of hopeless
isolation he had never lost consciousness of save when immersed
in study.</p>

<p>Ida subscribed for several of the “cheapest” of the
cheap magazines, and, when her Mongolians were indulgent,
rocked herself in the sitting-room, devouring the
factory sweets and crude mental drugs with much the
same spirit that revelled above bargain counters no matter
what the wares. She “lived” for the serials, and attempted
to discuss the “characters” with her husband
and John Oakley. But the foreman was politely intolerant
of cheap fiction, Gregory open in his disgust.</p>

<p>He admitted unequivocally that he had made a mistake,
but assuming that most men did, philosophically concluded
to make the best of it; women, after all, played but a
small part in a man’s life. He purposed, however, that
she should improve her mind, and would have been glad
to move to Butte for no other reason. He had had a
sudden vision one night, when his own mind, wearied with
study, drifted on the verge of sleep, of a lifetime on a
lonely ranch with a woman whose brain deteriorated from
year to year, her face faded and vacuous, save when animated
with temper. If the De Smet Ranch proved to be
mineralised, Oakley, his deliverer, would not be forgotten.</p>

<p>He moved his head restlessly, his glance darting over
as much of his fine estate as it could focus, wondering when
it would give up its secrets, in other words, its gold. He
had never doubted that it winked and gleamed, and waited
for him below the baffling surfaces of his land. Not for
millions down would he have sold his ranch, renounced
the personal fulfilment of that old passionate romance.</p>

<p>Gregory Compton was a dreamer, not in the drifting
and aimless fashion of the visionary, but as all men born
with creative powers, practical or artistic, must be. Indeed,
it is doubtful if the artistic brain—save possibly
where the abnormal tracts are musical in the highest sense—ever
need, much less develop, that leaping vision, that
power of visualising abstract ideas, of the men whose gifts<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>
for bold and original enterprise enable them to drive the
elusive wealth of the world first into a corner, then into
their own pockets.</p>

<p>When one contemplates the small army of men of great
wealth in the world today, and, just behind, that auxiliary
regiment endowed with the talent, the imagination, and
the grim assurance necessary to magnetise the circulating
riches of our planet; contemptuous of those hostile millions,
whose brains so often are of unleavened dough, always
devoid of talent, envious, hating, but sustained by the conceit
which nature stores in the largest of her reservoirs to
pour into the vacancies of the minds of men; seldom hopeless,
fooling themselves with dreams of a day when mere
brute numbers shall prevail, and (human nature having
been revolutionised by a miracle) all men shall be equal
and content to remain equal;—when one stands off and
contemplates these two camps, the numerically weak composed
of the forces of mind, the other of the unelectrified
yet formidable millions, it is impossible to deny not only
the high courage and supernormal gifts of the little army
of pirates, but that, barring the rapidly decreasing numbers
of explorers in the waste places of the earth, in them
alone is the last stronghold of the old adventurous spirit
that has given the world its romance.</p>

<p>The discontented, the inefficient, the moderately successful,
the failures, see only remorseless greed in the
great money makers. Their temper is too personal to
permit them to recognise that here are the legitimate inheritors
of the dashing heroes they enjoy in history, the
bold and ruthless egos that throughout the ages have
transformed savagery into civilisation, torpor into progress,
in their pursuit of gold. That these “doing” buccaneers
of our time are the current heroes of the masses, envious
or generous in tribute, the most welcome “copy” of the
daily or monthly press, is proof enough that the spirit of
adventure still flourishes in the universal heart, seldom
as modern conditions permit its expansion. For aught we
know it may be this old spirit of adventure that inspires
the midnight burglar and the gentlemen of the road, not
merely the desire for “easy money.” But these are the
flotsam. The boldest imaginations and the most romantic
hearts are sequestered in the American “big business”
men of today.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>Gregory Compton had grown to maturity in the most
romantic subdivision of the United States since California
retired to the position of a classic. Montana, her long
winter surface a reflection of the beautiful dead face of
the moon, bore within her arid body illimitable treasure,
yielding it from time to time to the more ardent and
adventurous of her lovers. Gold and silver, iron, copper,
lead, tungsten, precious and semi-precious stones—she
might have been some vast heathen idol buried aeons ago
when Babylon was but a thought in the Creator’s brain,
and the minor gods travelled the heaving spaces to immure
their treasure, stolen from rival stars.</p>

<p>Gregory had always individualised as well as idealised
his state, finding more companionship in her cold mysteries
than in the unfruitful minds of his little world. His
youthful dreams, when sawing wood or riding after cattle,
had been alternately of desperate encounters with Indians
and of descending abruptly into vast and glittering corridors.
The creek on the ranch had given up small quantities
of placer gold, enough to encourage “Old Compton,” least
imaginative of men, to use his pick up the side of the
gulch, and even to sink a shaft or two. But he had wasted
his money, and he had little faith in the mineral value of
the De Smet Ranch or in his own luck. He was a thrifty,
pessimistic, hard-working, down-east Presbyterian, whose
faith in predestination had killed such roots of belief in
luck as he may have inherited with other attributes of
man. He sternly discouraged his son’s hopes, which the
silent intense boy expressed one day in a sudden mood of
fervour and desire for sympathy, bidding him hang on to
the live stock, which were a certain sure source of income,
and go out and feed hogs when he felt onsettled like.</p>

<p>He died when Gregory was in the midst of his Junior
year in the School of Mines, and the eager student was
obliged to renounce his hope of a congenial career, for the
present, and assume control of the ranch. It was heavily
mortgaged; his father’s foreman, who had worked on the
ranch since he was a lad, had taken advantage of the old
man’s failing mind to raise the money, as well as to obtain
his signature to the sale of more than half the cattle. He
had disappeared with the concrete result a few days before
Mr. Compton’s death.</p>

<p>It was in no serene spirit that Gregory entered upon the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>
struggle for survival at the age of twenty-one. Bitterly
resenting his abrupt divorce from the School of Mines,
which he knew to be the gateway to his future, and his
faith in mankind dislocated by the cruel defection of one
whom he had liked and trusted from childhood, he seethed
under his stolid exterior while working for sixteen hours
a day to rid the ranch of its encumbrance and replace the
precious cattle. But as the greater part of this time was
spent out of doors he outgrew the delicacy of his youth
and earlier manhood, and, with red blood and bounding
pulses, his bitterness left him.</p>

<p>He began to visit Butte whenever he could spare a few
days from the ranch, to “look up” as his one chum, Mark
Blake, expressed it; so that by the time he married he
knew the life of a Western mining town—an education in
itself—almost as well as he knew the white and silent
spaces of Montana. With the passing of brooding and
revolt his old dreams revived, and he spent, until he married,
many long days prospecting. He had found nothing
until a few weeks ago, early in October, and then the discovery,
such as it was, had been accidental.</p>

<p>There had been a terrific wind storm, beginning shortly
after sundown, reaching at midnight a velocity of seventy-two
miles an hour, and lasting until morning; it had been
impossible to sleep or to go out of doors and see to the well-being
of the cattle.</p>

<p>The wind was not the Chinook, although it came out of
the west, for it was bitterly cold. Two of the house windows
facing the storm were blown in and the roof of a
recent addition went off. As such storms are uncommon
in Montana, even Gregory was uneasy, fearing the house
might go, although it had been his father’s boast that not
even an earthquake could uproot it. After daybreak the
steady fury of the storm ceased. There was much damage
done to the outbuildings, but, leaving Oakley to superintend
repairs, Gregory mounted his horse and rode over
the ranch to examine the fences and brush sheds. The
former were intact, and the cattle were huddled in their
shelters, which were built against the side of a steep hill.
A few, no doubt, had drifted before the storm, but would
return in the course of the day. Here and there a pine
tree had been blown over, but the winter wheat and alfalfa
were too young to be injured.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>He rode towards the hill where the wind had done its
most conspicuous damage. It was a long steep hill of
granite near the base and grey limestone above topped
with red shales, and stood near the northeast corner of
the ranch. Its rigid sides had been relieved by a small
grove of pines; but although in spring it was gay with
anemones and primrose moss, and green until late in July,
there was nothing on its ugly flanks at this time of the
year but sunburnt grass.</p>

<p>The old pines had clung tenaciously to the inhospitable
soil for centuries, but some time during the night, still
clutching a mass of earth and rock in their great roots,
they had gone down before the storm.</p>

<p>Gregory felt a pang of distress; in his boyhood that
grove of pines had been his retreat; there he had dreamed
his dreams, visualised the ascending metals, forced upward
from the earth’s magma by one of those old titanic
convulsions that make a joke of the modern earthquake, to
find a refuge in the long fissures of the cooler crust, or in
the great shattered zones. He knew something of geology
and chemistry when he was twelve, and he “saw” the great
primary deposits change their character as they were forced
closer to the surface, acted upon by the acids of air and
water in the oxide zone.</p>

<p>There he had lived down his disappointments, taken his
dumb trouble when his mother died; and he had found his
way blindly to the dark little grove after his father’s
funeral and he had learned the wrong that had been done
him.</p>

<p>He had not gone there since. He had been busy always,
and lost the habit. But now he remembered, and with
some wonder, for it was the one ugly spot on the ranch,
save in its brief springtime, that once it had drawn his
feet like a magnet. Hardly conscious of the act, he rode
to the foot of the hill, dismounted and climbed towards
the grove which had stood about fifty feet from the crest.</p>

<p>The ruin was complete. The grove, which once may
have witnessed ancient rites, was lying with its points in
the brown grass. Its gaunt roots, packed close with red
earth and pieces of rock, seemed to strain upward in
agonised protest. Men deserted on the battlefield at night
look hardly more stricken than a tree just fallen.</p>

<p>As Gregory approached his old friends his eyes grew<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>
narrower and narrower; his mind concentrated to a point
as sharp and penetrating as a needle. If the storm, now
fitful, had suddenly returned to its highest velocity he
would not have known it. He walked rapidly behind the
vanquished roots and picked out several bits of rock that
were embedded in the earth. Then he knelt down and
examined other pieces of rock in the excavation where the
trees had stood. Some were of a brownish-yellow colour,
others a shaded green of rich and mellow tints. There
was no doubt whatever that they were float.</p>

<p>He sat down suddenly and leaned against the roots of
the trees. Had he found his “mine”? Float indicates
an ore body somewhere, and as these particles had been
prevented from escaping by the roots of trees incalculably
old, it was reasonable to assume that the ores were beneath
his feet.</p>

<p>His brain resumed its normal processes, and he deliberately
gave his imagination the liberty of its youth. The
copper did not interest him, but he stared at the piece of
quartz in his hand as if it had been a seer’s crystal. He
saw great chambers of quartz flecked with free gold, connected
by pipes or shoots equally rich. Once he frowned,
the ruthlessly practical side of his intelligence reminding
him that his labours and hopes might be rewarded by a
shallow pocket. But he brushed the wagging finger aside.
He could have sworn that he felt the pull of the metals
within the hill.</p>

<p>He was tired and hungry, but his immediate impulse,
as soon as he had concluded that he had dreamed long
enough, was to go for his tools and run a cut. He sprang
to his feet; but he had taken only a few steps when he
turned and stared at the gashed earth, his head a little on
one side in an attitude that always indicated he was thinking
hard and with intense concentration. Then he set his
lips grimly, walked down the steep hillside, mounted his
horse, and rode home. In the course of the afternoon he
returned to the hill, picked all the pieces of float from the
soil between the tree-roots, and buried them, stamping
down the earth. A few days later there was a light fall
of snow. He returned once more to the hill, this time
with two of his labourers, who cut up the trees and hauled
them away. For the present his possible treasure vault
was restored to the seclusion of its centuries.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>He had made up his mind that the ores should stay
where they were until he had finished his education in
the School of Mines. He had planned to finish that course,
and what he planned he was in the habit of executing.
This was not the time for dreams, nor for prospecting, but
to learn all that the School could teach him. Then, if
there were valuable ore bodies in his hill he could be his
own manager and engineer. He knew that he had something
like genius for geology, also that many veins were
lost through an imperfect knowledge (or sense) of that
science in mining engineers; on the other hand, that the
prospector, in spite of his much vaunted sixth sense, often
failed, where the hidden ores were concerned, through
lack of scientific training. He determined to train his own
faculties as far as possible before beginning development
work on his hill. Let the prospector’s fever get possession
of him now and that would be the end of study. The hill
would keep. It was his. The ranch was patented.</p>

<p>When he had finished the interment of the float he had
taken a small notebook from his pocket and inscribed a
date: June the third, eighteen months later. Not until that
date would he even ride past his hill.</p>

<p>Born with a strong will and a character endowed with
force, determination and a grimly passive endurance, it
was his pleasure to test and develop both. The process was
satisfactory to himself but sometimes trying to his friends.</p>

<p>Until this morning he had not permitted his mind to
revert to the subject. But although the hill—Limestone
Hill it was called in the commonplace nomenclature of
the country—was far away and out of the range of his
vision, he could conjure it up in its minutest external
detail, and he permitted himself this luxury for a few
moments after his wife had left him to a welcome solitude.
On this hill were centred all his silent hopes.</p>

<p>If he had been greedy for riches alone he would have
promoted a company at once, if a cut opened up a chamber
that assayed well, and reaped the harvest with little or no
trouble to himself. But nothing was farther from his
mind. He wanted the supreme adventure. He wanted to
find the ores with his own pick. After the adventure,
then the practical use of wealth. There was much he
could do for his state. He knew also that in one group
of brain-cells, as yet unexplored, was the ambition to enter<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>
the lists of “doing” men, and pit his wits against the
best of them. But he was young, he would have his adventure,
live his dream first. Not yet, however.</p>

<p>The swift passing of his marital illusions had convinced
him that the real passion of his life was for Montana and
the golden blood in her veins. Placer mining never had
interested him. He wanted to find his treasure deep in
the jealous earth. He assured himself as he stood there
in the blue dawn that it was well to be rid of love so early
in the game, free to devote himself, with no let from wandering
mind and mere human pulses, to preparation for
the greatest of all romances, the romance of mining. That
he might ever crave the companionship of one woman was
as remote from his mind as the possibility of failure. To
learn all that man and experience could teach him of the
science that has been so great a factor in the world’s
progress; to magnetise a vast share of Earth’s riches,
first for the hot work of the battle, then for the power it
would give him; to conquer life; these were a few of the
flitting dreams that possessed him as he watched the red
flame lick the white crests of the mountains, and the blue
clouds turn to crimson; his long sensitive lips folded
closely, his narrow eyes penetrating the mists of the future,
neither seeing nor considering its obstacles, its barriers,
its disenchantments. Thrice happy are the dreamers of
the world, when their imaginations are creative, not a
mere maggot wandering through the brain hatching formless
eggs of desire and discontent. They are the true inheritors
of the centuries, whether they succeed or fail in
the eyes of men; for they live in vivid silent intense drama
as even they have no power to live and enjoy in mortal
conditions.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">THE Comptons were quickly settled in the little cottage
in East Granite Street, for as Mrs. Hook’s furniture
was solid Ida had not sold it. There was little to do, therefore,
but repaper the walls, build a bathroom, furnish a
dining-room, send the parlour furniture to the upholsterers—Ida
had had enough of horsehair—and chattel the
kitchen.</p>

<p>Ida had several virtues in which she took a vocal pride,
and not the least of these was housekeeping in all its
variety. The luxurious side of her nature might revel in
front parlours, trashy magazines, rocking-chairs and chewing-gum,
but she never indulged in these orgies unless
her house were in order. After her arrival in Butte it
was quite a month before she gave a thought to leisure.
They spent most of this time at a hotel, but Ida was out
before the stores opened, and divided her day between
the workmen at the cottage, the upholsterer, and the bargain
counter. She was “on the job” every minute until
the cottage was “on wheels.” Her taste was neither original
nor artistic, but she had a rude sense of effect, and a
passion for what she called colour schemes. She boasted
to Gregory at night, when she had him at her mercy at
the hotel dinner-table, that although everything had to be
cheap except the kitchen furnishings, colours did not cost
any more than black or drab. When the cottage was in
order, and they moved in, he saw its transfigured interior
for the first time. The bedroom was done in a pink that
set his teeth on edge, and the little parlour was papered,
upholstered, carpeted, cushioned in every known shade of
red.</p>

<p>“All you want is a chromo or two of Indian battlegrounds—just
after,” he remarked.</p>

<p>Ida interrupted tartly:</p>

<p>“Well, I should think you’d be grateful for the contrast<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>
to them everlasting white or brown mountains. We don’t
get away from them even in town, now the smoke’s gone.”</p>

<p>“One would think Montana had no springtime.”</p>

<p>“Precious little. That’s the reason I’ve got a green
dining-room.”</p>

<p>Gregory, who had suffered himself to be pushed into an
arm-chair, looked at his wife speculatively, as she rocked
herself luxuriously, her eyes dwelling fondly on the magenta
paper, the crimson curtains, the turkey red and
crushed strawberry cushions of the divan, the blood-red
carpet with its still more sanguinary pattern. What blind
struggle was going on in that uninstructed brain against
the commonplace, what seed of originality, perhaps, striving
to shoot forth a green tip from the hard crust of
ignorance and conceit?</p>

<p>He had made up his mind to suggest the tillage of that
brain without delay, but, knowing her sensitive vanity, cast
about for a tactful opening.</p>

<p>“Do you really intend to do your own work?” he asked.
“I am more than willing to pay for a servant.”</p>

<p>“Not much. I’m goin’ to begin to save up for the future
right now. I’ll put out the wash, but it’s a pity if a
great husky girl like me can’t cook for two and keep this
little shack clean. You ain’t never goin’ to be able to say
I didn’t help you all I could.”</p>

<p>Gregory glowed with gratitude as he looked at the beautiful
face of has wife, flushed with the ardour of the true
mate.</p>

<p>“You are all right,” he murmured.</p>

<p>“The less we spend the quicker we’ll get rich,” pursued
Mrs. Compton. “I don’t mind this triflin’ work, but it
would have made me sick to stay much longer on that
ranch workin’ away my youth and looks and nothin’ to
show for it. Now that you’ve really begun on somethin’
high-toned and that’s bound to be a go, I just like the idea
of havin’ a hand in the job.”</p>

<p>“Ah!— Well— If you have this faith in my power to
make a fortune—if you are looking forward to being a
rich man’s wife, to put it crudely—don’t you think you
should begin to prepare yourself for the position——”</p>

<p>“Now what are you drivin’ at?” She sprang to her
feet. Her eyes blazed. Her hands went to her hips.
“D’you mean to say I ain’t good enough? I suppose you’d<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>
be throwin’ me over for a grand dame when you get up in
the world like some other millionaires we know of, let
alone politicians what get to thinkin’ themselves statesmen,
and whose worn-out old wives ain’t good enough for
’em. Well, take this from me and take it straight—I don’t
propose to wear out, and I don’t propose——”</p>

<p>“Sit down. I shall be a rich man long before you lose
your beauty. Nor have I any social ambitions. The world
of men is all that interests me. But with you it will be
different——”</p>

<p>“You may betcherlife it’ll be different—some! When I
have a cream-coloured pressed brick house with white
trimmings over there in Millionaire Gulch nobody’ll be
too good for me.”</p>

<p>“You shall live your life to suit yourself, in the biggest
house in Butte, if that is what you want. But there is
more in it than that.”</p>

<p>“Clothes, of course. <i>Gowns!</i> And jewels, and New
York—Lord! wouldn’t I like to swell up and down Peacock
Ally! And Southern California, and Europe, and
givin’ balls, and bein’ a member of the Country Club.”</p>

<p>“All that, as a matter of course! But you would not
be content with the mere externals. Whether you know
it or not, Ida, you are an ambitious woman.” This was
a mere gambler’s throw on Gregory’s part. He knew
nothing of her ambitions, and would have called them by
another name if he had.</p>

<p>“Not know it? Well, you may just betcherlife I know
it!”</p>

<p>“But hardly where ambition leads. No sooner would
you be settled in a fine house, accustomed to your new toys,
than you would want society. I don’t mean that you
would have any difficulty gaining admittance to Butte
society, for it is said that none in the world is more hospitable
and less particular. But whether you make <i>friends</i>
of the best people here, much less become a leader, depends—well,
upon several things——”</p>

<p>“Fire away,” said Ida sulkily. “You must be considerable
in earnest to talk a blue streak!”</p>

<p>“Business may take me to New York from time to time,
but my home shall remain here. I never intend to abandon
my state and make a fool of myself on New York’s
doorstep as so many Montanans have done. Nail up that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>
fact and never forget it. Now, you would like to win an
unassailable position in your community, would you not?”</p>

<p>“Yep.”</p>

<p>Gregory abandoned tact. “Then begin at once to prepare
yourself. You must have a teacher and study—English,
above all things.”</p>

<p>“My Goo-r-rd!” She flushed almost purple. For the
moment she hated him. “I’ve always suspicioned you
thought I wasn’t good enough for you, with your graduatin’
from the High School almost while you was in short
pants, and them two years and over at that high-brow
School of Mines; and now you’re tellin’ me you’ll be
ashamed of me the minute you’re on top!”</p>

<p>Gregory made another attempt at diplomacy. What
his wife achieved socially was a matter of profound indifference
to him, but she must reform her speech if his
home life was to be endurable.</p>

<p>“I am forcing my imagination to keep pace with your
future triumphs,” he said with the charming smile that
disarmed even Ida when irate. “If you are going to be
a prominent figure in society——”</p>

<p>“My land, you oughter heard the grammar and slang
of some of the newest West Siders when they were makin’
up their minds at Madame O’Reilley’s, or havin’ their
measures took. They don’t frighten me one little bit.”</p>

<p>“There is a point. To lead them you must be their
superior—and the equal of those that have made the most
of their advantages.”</p>

<p>“That’s not such a bad idea.”</p>

<p>“Think it over.” He rose, for he was tired of the conversation.
“These western civilisations are said to be
crude, but I fancy they are the world in little. Subtlety,
a brain developed beyond the common, should go far——”</p>

<p>“Greg, you are dead right!” She had suddenly remembered
that she must play up to this man who held her
ambitions in his hand, and she had the wit to acknowledge
his prospicience, little as were the higher walks of learning
to her taste. She sprang to her feet with a supple undulating
movement and flung herself into his arms.</p>

<p>“I’ll begin the minute you find me a teacher,” she exclaimed.
Then she kissed him. “I’m goin’ to keep right
along with you and make you proud of me,” she murmured.
“I’m crazy about you and always will be. Swear<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>
right here you’ll never throw me over, or run round with
a P’rox.”</p>

<p>Gregory laughed, but held her off for a moment and
stared into her eyes. After all, might not study and travel
and experience give depth to those classic eyes which now
seemed a mere joke of Nature? Was she merely the
natural victim of her humble conditions? Her father had
been a miner of a very superior sort, conservative and contemptuous
of agitators, but a powerful voice in his union
and respected alike by men and managers. Mrs. Hook had
been a shrewd, hard-working, tight-fisted little woman
from Concord, who had never owed a penny, nor turned
out a careless piece of work. Both parents with education
or better luck might have taken a high position in any
western community. He knew also the preternatural
quickness and adaptability of the American woman. But
could a common mind achieve distinction?</p>

<p>Ida, wondering “what the devil he was thinking about,”
nestled closer and gave him a long kiss, her woman’s wisdom,
properly attributed to the serpent, keeping her otherwise
mute. Gregory snatched her suddenly to him and
returned her kiss. The new hope revived a passion by no
means dead for this beautiful young creature, and for the
hour he was as happy as during his rosy honeymoon.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">WHEN the cottage was quite in order Mrs. Compton
invited two of her old friends to lunch. As the
School of Mines was at the opposite end of the city, Gregory
took his midday meal with him.</p>

<p>Miss Ruby Miller and her twin-sister Pearl were fine
examples of the self-supporting young womanhood of the
West. Neither had struggled in the extreme economic
sense, although when launched they had taken a man’s
chances and asked no quarter. Born in a small town in
Illinois, their father, a provident grocer, had permitted
each of his daughters to attend school until her fifteenth
year, then sent her to Chicago to learn a trade. Ruby had
studied the mysteries of the hair, complexion, and hands;
Pearl the science that must supplement the knack for
trimming hats. Both worked faithfully as apprentice and
clerk, saving the greater part of their earnings: they purposed
to set up for themselves in some town of the Northwest
where money was easier, opportunities abundant and
expertness rare. What they heard of Montana appealed
to their enterprising minds, and, beginning with cautious
modesty, some four years before Ida’s marriage, Ruby
was now the leading hair-dresser and manicure of Butte,
her pleasant address and natural diplomacy assisting her
competent hands to monopolise the West Side custom;
Pearl, although less candid and engaging, more frank in
reminding her customers of their natural deficiencies, was
equally capable; if not the leading milliner in that town
of many milliners, where even the miners’ wives bought
three hats a season, she was rapidly making a reputation
among the feathered tribe. She now ranked as one of
the most successful of the young business women in a
region where success is ever the prize of the efficient. Both
she and her sister were as little concerned for their future
as the metal hill of Butte itself.</p>

<p>“Well, what do you know about that?” they cried<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>
simultaneously, as Ida ushered them into the parlour.
“Say, it’s grand!” continued Miss Ruby with fervour.
“Downright artistic. Ide, you’re a wonder!”</p>

<p>Miss Pearl, attuned to a subtler manipulation of colour,
felt too happy in this intimate reunion and the prospect
of “home-cooking,” to permit even her spirit to grin.
“Me for red, kiddo,” she said. “It’s the colour a hard
workin’ man or woman wants at the end of the day—warm,
and comfortin’, and sensuous-like, and contrastin’
fine with dirty streets and them hills. Glory be, but this
chair’s comfortable! I suppose it’s Greg’s.”</p>

<p>“Of course. Luckily a woman don’t have the least
trouble findin’ out a man’s weak points, and Greg has a
few, thank the goodness godness. But come on to the
dining-room. I’ve got fried chicken and creamed potatoes
and raised biscuit.”</p>

<p>The guests shrieked with an abandon that proclaimed
them the helpless victims of the Butte restaurant or the
kitchenette. The fried chicken in its rich gravy, and the
other delicacies, including fruit salad, disappeared so rapidly
that there was little chance for the play of intellect
until the two girls fled laughing to the parlour.</p>

<p>“It’s all very well for Pearl,” cried Miss Ruby, disposing
her plump figure in Gregory’s arm-chair, and taking
the pins from a mass of red hair that had brought her
many a customer; “for she’s the kind that’ll never have
to diet if she gets rich quick. I ought to be shassaying
round with my hands on my hips right now, but I
won’t.”</p>

<p>Miss Pearl extended herself on the divan, and Ida rocked
herself with a complacent smile. One of her vanities was
slaked, and she experienced a sense of immense relief in
the society of these two old friends of her own sort.</p>

<p>“Say!” exclaimed Miss Miller, “if we was real swell,
now, we’d be smokin’ cigarettes.”</p>

<p>“What!” cried Ida, scandalised. “No lady’d do such
a thing. Say, I forgot the gum.”</p>

<p>She opened a drawer and flirted an oblong section of
chewing-gum at each of her guests, voluptuously inserting
a morsel in the back of her own mouth. “Where on earth
have you seen ladies smokin’ cigarettes?”</p>

<p>“You forget I’m in and out of some of our best families.
In other words them that’s too swell—or too lazy—to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>
come to me, has me up to them. And they’re just as
nice—most of ’em—as they can be; no more airs than
their men, and often ask me to stay to lunch. I ain’t
mentionin’ no names, as I was asked not to, for you know
what an old-fashioned bunch there is in every Western
town—well, they out with their gold tips after lunch, and
maybe you think they don’t know how. I have my doubts
as to their enjoyin’ it, for tobacco is nasty tastin’ stuff,
and I notice they blow the smoke out quicker’n they take
it in. No inhalin’ for them. But they like <i>doin’</i> it; that’s
the point. And I guess they do it a lot at the Country
Club and at some of the dinners where the Old Guard
ain’t asked. They smoke, and think it’s vulgar to chew
gum! We know it’s the other way round.”</p>

<p>“Well, I guess!” exclaimed the young matron, who had
listened to this chronicle of high life with her mouth open.
“What their husbands thinkin’ about to permit such a
thing! I can see Greg’s face if I lit up.”</p>

<p>“Oh, their husbands don’t care,” said Pearl, the cynic.
“Not in that bunch. They’re trained, and they don’t
care, anyhow. Make the most of Greg now, kiddo. When
he strikes it rich, he’ll be just like the rest of ’em, annexin’
right and left. Matter of principle.”</p>

<p>“Principle nothing!” exclaimed Ruby, who, highly
sophisticated as any young woman earning her living in
a mining town must be, was always amiable in her cynicism.
“It’s too much good food and champagne, to say
nothin’ of cocktails and highballs and swell club life after
the lean and hungry years. They’re just like kids turned
loose in a candy store, helpin’ themselves right and left
with both hands. Dear old boys, they’re so happy and so
jolly you can’t help feelin’ real maternal over ’em, and
spoilin’ ’em some more. I often feel like it, even when
they lay for me—they look so innocent and hungry-like;
but others I could crack over the ear, and I don’t say I
haven’t. Lord, how a girl alone does get to know men! I
wouldn’t marry one of them if he’d give me the next level
of the Anaconda mine. Me for the lonesome!”</p>

<p>“Well, I’m glad I’m married,” said Ida complacently.
“The kind of life I want you can only get through a husband.
Greg’s goin’ to make money, all right.”</p>

<p>“Greg won’t be as bad as some,” said the wise Miss
Ruby. “He’s got big ideas, and as he don’t say much<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>
about ’em, he’s likely thinkin’ about nothin’ else. At
least that’s the way I figure him out. The Lord knows
I’ve seen enough of men. But you watch out just the
same. Them long thin ones that looks like they was all
brains and jaw is often the worst. They’ve got more
nerves. The minute the grind lets up they begin to look
out for an adventure, wonderin’ what’s round the next
corner. Wives ain’t much at supplyin’ adventure——”</p>

<p>“Well, let’s quit worryin’ about what ain’t happened,”
said Miss Pearl abruptly. Men did not interest her.
“Will he take you to any of the dances? That’s what I
want to know. You’ve been put up and elected to our
new and exclusive Club. No more Coliseum Saturday
Nights for us—Race Track is a good name for it. We’ve
taken a new little hall over Murphy’s store for Saturday
nights till the Gardens open up, and we have real fun.
No rowdyism. We leave that to the cut below. This Club
is composed of real nice girls and young men of Butte who
are workin’ hard at something high-toned and respectable,
and frown hard on the fast lot.”</p>

<p>“Sounds fine. Perhaps Greg’ll go, though he studies
half the night. Do you meet at any other time? Is it
one of them mind improvers, too?”</p>

<p>“Nixie. We work all week and want fun when we get
a few hours off. I improve my mind readin’ myself to
sleep every night——”</p>

<p>“What do you read?” interrupted Ida, eagerly.</p>

<p>“Oh, the mags, of course, and a novel now and then.
But you don’t need novels any more. The mags are wonders!
They teach you all the life you don’t know—all
the way from lords to burglars. Then there’s the movin’
pictures. Lord, but we have advantages our poor mothers
never dreamed of!”</p>

<p>“Greg wants me to study with a teacher.” Ida frowned
reminiscently and fatidically. “He seems to think I didn’t
get nothin’ at school.”</p>

<p>“Well, what do you know about that?” gasped Miss
Miller. Pearl removed her gum with a dry laugh.</p>

<p>“If a man insinuated I wasn’t good enough for him—”
she began; Ruby, whose quick mind was weather-wise, interrupted
her.</p>

<p>“Greg’s right. He’s got education himself and’s proved
he don’t mean to be a rancher all his life. What’s more,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>
I’ve heard men say that Gregory Compton is bound one
way or another to be one of the big men of Montana. He’s
got the brains, he’s got the jaw, and he can outwork any
miner that ever struck, and no bad habits. Ide, you go
ahead and polish up.”</p>

<p>“Why should I? I never could see that those bonanzerines
were so much better’n us, barring clothes.”</p>

<p>“You don’t know the best of ’em, Ide. Madame O’Reilley
was too gaudy to catch any but the newest bunch. The
old pioneer guard is fine, and their girls have been educated
all over this country and the next. Lord! Look at
Ora Blake! Where’d you beat her? In these new Western
towns it’s generally the sudden rich that move to New
York to die of lonesomeness, and nowhere to show their
clothes but Peacock Alley in the Waldorf-Astoria. The
<i>real</i> people keep their homes here, if they are awful restless;
and I guess the Society they make, with their imported
gowns and all, ain’t so very different from top Society
anywheres. Of course, human nature is human
nature, and some of the younger married women are sporty
and take too much when a bunch goes over to Boulder
Springs for a lark, or get a crush on some other woman’s
husband—for want mostly of something to do; but their
grammar’s all right. I hope you’ll teach them a lesson
when you’re on top, Ide. Good American morals for me,
like good American stories. I always skip the Europe
stories in the mags. Don’t seem modern and human, somehow,
after Butte.”</p>

<p>“Now I like Europe stories,” said Ida, “just because
they are so different. The people in ’em ain’t walkin’
round over gold and copper when they’re dishwashin’ or
makin’ love, but their mines have been turned centuries
ago into castles and pictures and grand old parks. There’s
a kind of halo——”</p>

<p>“Halo nothin’!” exclaimed Miss Pearl, who was even
more aggressively American than her sister. “It’s them
ridiculous titles. And kings and queens and all that antique
lot. I despise ’em, and I’m dead set against importin’
foreign notions into God’s own country. We’re
dyed-in-the-wool Americans—out West here, anyhow—including
every last one of them fools that’s buyin’ new
notions with their new money. All their Paris clothes
<i>and</i> hats, <i>and</i> smokin’ cigarettes, <i>and</i> loose talk can’t<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>
make ’em anything else. Apin’ Europe and its antiquated
morals makes me sick to my stomach. Cut it out, kid,
before you go any further. Stand by your own country
and it’ll stand by you.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’ve got an answer to that. In the first place
I’d like to know where you’ll find more girls on the loose
than right here in Butte—and I don’t mean the sporting
women, either. Why, I meet bunches of schoolgirls every
day so painted up they look as if they was fixin’ right
now to be bad; and as for these Eastern workin’ girls who
come out here after jobs, pretendin’ it’s less pressure and
bigger pay they’re after, when it’s really to turn loose and
give human nature a chance with free spenders—well, the
way they hold down their jobs and racket about all night
beats me. None of <i>them’s</i> been to Europe, I notice, and
I’d like to bet that the schoolgirls that don’t make monkeys
of themselves is the daughters of them that has.”</p>

<p>“Oh, the schoolgirls is just plain little fools and no
doubt has their faces held under the spout for ’em when
they get home. But as for the Eastern girls, you hit it
when you said they come out here to give human nature a
chance. Some girls is born bad, thousands and thousands
of them; and reformers might just as well try to grow
strawberries in a copper smelter as to make a girl run
straight when she is lyin’ awake nights thinkin’ up new
ways of bein’ crooked. But the rotten girls in this town
are not the whole show. And lots of women that would
never think of goin’ wrong—don’t naturally care for that
sort of thing a bit—just get their minds so mixed up by
too much sudden money, and liberty, and too much high
livin’ and too much Europe and too much nothin’ to do,
that they just don’t know where they’re at; and it isn’t
long either before they get to thinkin’ they’re not the
dead swell thing unless they do what the nobility of Europe
seems to be doin’ all the time——”</p>

<p>“Shucks!” interrupted Ruby, indignantly. “It’s just
them stories in the shady mags, and the way our women
talk for the sake of effect. There’s bad in America and
good in poor old Europe. I’ll bet my new hat on it. Only,
over there the good is out of sight under all that sportin’
high life everybody seems to write about. Over here
we’ve got a layer of good on top as thick as cream, and
every kind of germ swimmin’ round underneath. Lord<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>
knows there are plenty of just females in this town, of all
towns, but the U. S. is all right because it has such high
standards. All sorts of new-fangled notions come and go
but them standards never budge. No other country has
anything like ’em. Sooner or later we’ll catch up. I’m
great on settin’ the right example and I’m dead set on
uplift. That’s one reason we’re so strict about our Club
membership. Not one of them girls can get in, no matter
how good her job or how swell a dresser she is. And they
feel it, too, you bet. The line’s drawn like a barbed-wire
fence.”</p>

<p>“I guess you’re dead right,” admitted Ida. “And my
morals ain’t in any danger, believe me. I’ve got other fish
to fry. I’ve had love’s young dream and got over it. I’m
just about dead sick of that side of life. I’d cut it out and
put it down to profit and loss, but you’ve got to manage
men every way nature’s kindly provided, and that’s all
there is to it.”</p>

<p>“My land!” exclaimed Ruby. “If I felt that way about
my husband I’d leave him too quick.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no, you wouldn’t. You can make up your mind
to any old thing. That’s life. And I guess life never
holds out both hands full at once. Either, one’s got a
knife in it or it’s out of sight altogether.”</p>

<p>Ruby snorted with disgust. “Once more I vow I’ll
marry none of them. Me for self-respect.”</p>

<p>“Now as to Europe,” pursued Ida. “You’re just nothin’
till you’ve been, both as to what you get, and sayin’
you’ve been there——”</p>

<p>“Ida,” said Ruby, shaking her wise red head, “don’t
you go leaving your husband summers, like the rest. Men
don’t get much chance to go to Europe. They prefer little
old New York, anyhow—when they get on there alone.
I wonder what ten thousand wives that go to Europe every
summer think their husbands are doin’? I haven’t manicured
men for nine years without knowin’ they need
watchin’ every minute. Why, my lord! they’re so tickled
to death when summer comes round they can hardly wait
to kiss their wives good-bye and try to look lonesome on the
platform. They’d like to be down and kick up their heels
right there at the station. And I didn’t have to come to
Butte to find that out.”</p>

<p>“Greg’ll never run with that fast lot.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>“No, but he might meet an affinity; and there’s one of
<i>them</i> lyin’ in wait for every man.”</p>

<p>Ida’s brow darkened. “Well, just let her look out for
herself, that’s all. I’ll hang on to Greg. But it ain’t time
to worry yet. Let’s have a game of poker.”</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">VI</h3>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">GREGORY, through the offices of his friend, Mark
Blake, found a teacher for Ida before the end of the
week, Mr. William Cullen Whalen, Professor of English
in the Butte High School.</p>

<p>Mr. Whalen’s present status was what he was in the
habit of designating as an ignominious anti-climax, considering
his antecedents and attainments; but he always
dismissed the subject with a vague, “Health—health—this
altitude—this wonderful air—climate—not for me are the
terrible extremes of our Atlantic seaboard. Here a man
may be permitted to live, if not in the deeper sense—well,
at least, there are always one’s thoughts—and books.”</p>

<p>He was a delicate little man as a matter of fact, but had
East winds and summer humidities been negligible he
would have jumped at the position found for him by a
college friend who had gone West and prospered in Montana.
This friend’s letter had much to say about the dry
tonic air of winter, the cool light air of summer, the many
hours he would be able to pass in the open, thus deepening
the colour of his corpuscles, at present a depressing
shade of pink; but even more about a salary far in excess
of anything lying round loose in the East. Mr. Whalen,
who, since his graduation from the college in his native
town, had knocked upon several historic portals of learning
in vain, finding himself invariably outclassed, had
shuddered, but accepted his fate by the outgoing mail. Of
course he despised the West; and the mere thought of a
mining camp like Butte, which was probably in a drunken
uproar all the time, almost nauseated him. However, in
such an outpost the graduate of an Eastern college who
knew how to wear his clothes must rank high above his
colleagues. It might be years before he could play a similar
rôle at home. So he packed his wardrobe, which included
spats and a silk hat, and went.</p>

<p>Nature compensates even her comparative failures by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>
endowing them with a deathless self-conceit. Whalen was
a man of small abilities, itching ambition, all the education
his brains could stand, and almost happy in being himself
and a Whalen. It was true that Fortune had grafted him
on a well-nigh sapless branch in a small provincial town,
while the family trunk flourished, green, pruned, and
portly, in Boston, but no such trifle could alter the fact
that he was a Whalen, and destined by a discriminating
heredity to add to the small but precious bulk of America’s
literature. Although he found Butte a city of some sixty
thousand inhabitants, and far better behaved than he had
believed could be possible in a community employing some
fifteen thousand miners, he was still able to reassure himself
that she outraged every sensibility. He assured himself
further that its lurid contrasts to the higher civilisation
would play like a search-light upon the theme for a novel
he long had had in mind: the subtle actions and reactions
of the Boston temperament.</p>

<p>But that was three years ago, and meanwhile several
things had happened to him. He had ceased to wear his
spats and silk hat in public after their first appearance
on Broadway; the newsboys, who were on strike, had seen
to that. He wrote his novel, and the <i>Atlantic Monthly</i>,
honored by the first place on his list, declined to give space
to his innocent plagiarisms of certain anæmic if literary
authors now passing into history. An agent sent the
manuscript the rounds without avail, but one of the
younger editors had suggested that he try his hand at
Montana. He was more shocked and mortified at this
proposition than at the failure of his novel. Time, however,
as well as the high cost of living in Butte, lent him
a grudging philosophy, and he digested the advice. But
his were not the eyes that see. The printed page was his
world, his immediate environment but a caricature of the
subtle realities. Nevertheless, he had what so often appears
in the most unlikely brains, the story-telling kink. Given
an incident he could work it up with an abundance of detail
and “psychology,” easily blue-pencilled, and a certain
illusion. Condescend to translate his present surroundings
into the sacred realm of American fiction he would not,
but he picked the brains of old-timers for thrilling incidents
of the days when gold was found at the roots of
grass, and the pioneers either were terrorized by the lawless<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>
element or executed upon it a summary and awful justice.
Some of his tales were so blood-curdling, so steeped in
gore and horror, that he felt almost alive when writing
them. It was true that their market was the Sunday
Supplement and the more sensational magazines, whose
paper and type made his soul turn green; but the pay was
excellent, and they had begun to attract some attention,
owing to the contrast between the fierceness of theme and
the neat precise English in which it was served. Butte
valued him as a counter-irritant to Mary McLane, and he
became a professional diner-out.</p>

<p>“Do you think he’ll condescend to tutor?” Gregory had
asked of Blake. Whalen was by no means unknown to
him, but heretofore had been regarded as a mere worm.</p>

<p>“Sure thing. Nobody keener on the dollar than Whalen.
He’ll stick you, but he knows his business. He’s got
all the words there are, puts ’em in the right place, and
tones ’em up so you’d hardly know them.”</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">VII</h3>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">IDA was out when her prospective tutor called, and she
was deeply impressed by the card she found under the
door: “Mr. William Cullen Whalen,” it was inscribed.</p>

<p>It was the custom of the gentlemen of her acquaintance
to express their sense of good fellowship even upon the
formal pasteboard. “Mr. Matt Dance,” “Mr. Phil Mott,”
“Mr. Bill Jarvis,” the legends read. Ida felt as if she
were reciting a line from the Eastern creed as her lips
formed again and again the suave and labial syllables on
her visitor’s card. She promptly determined to order
cards for her husband on the morrow—he was so remiss
as to have none—and they should be engraved, in small
Roman letters: “Mr. Gregory Verrooy Compton.”</p>

<p>“And believe me,” she announced to her green dining-room,
as she sat down before her husband’s desk, “that is
some name.”</p>

<p>Her note to Professor Whalen, asking him to call on the
following afternoon at two o’clock, was commendably brief,
so impatient was she to arrive at the signature, “Mrs.
Gregory Verrooy Compton;” little conceiving the effect
it would have upon Mr. Whalen’s fastidious spine.</p>

<p>He called at the hour named, and Ida invited him into
the dining-room. It was here that Gregory read far into
the night, and she vaguely associated a large table with
much erudition. Moreover, she prided herself upon her
economy in fuel.</p>

<p>Mr. Whalen sat in one of the hard, upright chairs, his
stick across his knee, his gloves laid smartly in the rolling
brim of his hat, studying this new specimen and wondering
if she could be made to do him credit. He was surprised
to find her so beautiful, and not unrefined in style—if only
she possessed the acumen to keep her ripe mouth shut. In
fact he found her quite the prettiest woman he had seen
in Butte, famous for pretty women; and—and—he searched<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>
conscientiously for the right word, and blushed as he
found it—the most seductive. Ida was vain of the fact
that she wore no corset, and that not the least of her
attractions was a waist as flexible as an acrobat’s. What
flesh she had was very firm, her carriage was easy and
graceful, the muscles of her back were strong, her lines
long and flowing; she walked and moved at all times with
an undulating movement usually associated with a warmer
temperament. But nature often amuses herself bestowing
the semblance and withholding the essence; Ida, calculating
and contemptuous of the facile passions of men,
amused herself with them, confident of her own immunity.</p>

<p>It was now some time since she had enjoyed the admiration
of any man but her husband, and his grew more and
more sporadic, was long since dry of novelty. Like most
Western husbands, he would not have permitted her to
make a friend of any other man, nor even to receive the
casual admirer when he was not at home. Ida was full of
vanity, although she would have expressed her sudden determination
to captivate “little Whalen” merely as a
desire to keep her hand in. He was the only man upon
whom she was likely to practise at present (for Gregory
would have none of the Club dances), and vanity can
thirst like a galled palate. She had “sized him up” as a
“squirt” (poor Ida! little she recked how soon she was
to be stripped of her picturesque vocabulary), but he was
“a long sight better than nothing.”</p>

<p>After they had exhausted the nipping weather, and the
possibility of a Chinook arriving before night—there was
a humming roar high overheard at the moment—she lowered
her black eyelashes, lifted herself against the stiff
back of her chair with the motion of a snake uncoiling,
raised her thick white lids suddenly, and murmured:</p>

<p>“Well, so you’re goin’ to polish me off? Tell me all my
faults! Fire away. I know you’ll make a grand success
of it. Lord knows (her voice became as sweet as honey),
you’re different enough from the other men in this jay
town.”</p>

<p>Mr. Whalen felt as if he were being drenched with
honey dew, for he was the type of man whom women take
no trouble to educate. But as that sweet unmodulated
voice stole about his ear porches he drew himself up stiffly,
conscious of a thrill of fear. To become enamoured of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>
wife of one of these forthright Westerners, who took the
law into their own hands, was no part of his gentle programme;
but he stared at her fascinated, never having felt
anything resembling a thrill before. Moreover, like all people
of weak passions, more particularly that type of American
that hasn’t any, he took pride in his powers of self-control.
In a moment he threw off the baleful influence
and replied drily.</p>

<p>“I think the lessons would better be oral for a time.
Do—do I understand that I am to correct your individual
method of expression?”</p>

<p>“That’s it, I guess.”</p>

<p>“And you won’t be offended?” Mr. Whalen’s upper
teeth were hemispheric, but he had cultivated a paternal
and not unpleasing smile. Even the pale blue orbs, fixed
defiantly upon the siren, warmed a trifle.</p>

<p>“Well. I don’t s’pose I’ll like bein’ corrected better’n
the next, but that’s what I’m payin’ for. Now that my
husband’s studyin’ for a profession, I guess I’ll be in the
top set before so very long. There’s Mrs. Blake, for instance—her
husband told Mr. Compton she’d call this
week. Is she all that she’s cracked up to be?”</p>

<p>“Mrs. Blake has had great advantages. She might almost
be one of our own products, were it not for the fact
that she—well—seems deliberately to wish to be Western.”
He found himself growing more and more confused under
the steady regard of those limpid shadowy eyes—set like
the eyes of a goddess in marble, and so disconcertingly
shallow. He pulled himself up sharply. “Now, if I may
begin—you must not sign your notes, ‘Mrs. Gregory Verrooy
Compton’——”</p>

<p>Ida’s eyes flashed wide open. “Why not, I’d like to
know? Isn’t it as good a name as yours?”</p>

<p>“What has that to do with it? Ah—yes—you don’t
quite understand. It is not the custom—in what we call
society—to sign in that manner—it is a regrettable American
provincialism. If you really wish to learn——”</p>

<p>“Fire away,” said Ida sullenly.</p>

<p>“Sign your own name—may I ask what it is?”</p>

<p>“My name was Ida Maria Hook before I married.”</p>

<p>“Ida is a beautiful and classic name. We will eliminate
the rest. Sign yourself Ida Compton—or if you wish to
be more swagger, Ida Verrooy Compton——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>“Land’s sake! We’d be laughed clean out of Montana.”</p>

<p>“Yes, there is a fine primitive simplicity about many
things in this region,” replied Mr. Whalen, thinking of
his spats and silk hat. “But you get my point?”</p>

<p>“I get you.”</p>

<p>“Oh!—We’ll have a little talk later about slang. And
you mustn’t begin your letters, particularly to an acquaintance,
‘Dear friend.’ This is an idealistic and—ah—bucolic
custom, but hardly good form.”</p>

<p>He was deeply annoyed at his lack of fluency, but Ida
once more was deliberately “upsetting” him. She smiled
indulgently.</p>

<p>“I guess I like your new-fangled notions. I’ll write all
that down while you’re thinkin’ up what to say next.”</p>

<p>She leaned over the table and wrote slowly that he might
have leisure to admire her figure in profile. But he gazed
sternly out of the window until she swayed back to the
perpendicular and demanded,</p>

<p>“What next? Do you want me to say băth and căn’t?”</p>

<p>“Oh, no, I really shouldn’t advise it, not in Butte. I
don’t wish to teach you anything that will add to the discomforts
of life—so long as your lines are cast here. Just
modify the lamentably short American <i>a</i> a bit.” And he
rehearsed her for a few moments.</p>

<p>“Fine. I’ll try it on Greg—Mr. Compton. If he laughs
I’ll know I’m too good, but if he only puckers his eyebrows
and looks as if somethin’ queer was floatin’ round just out
of sight, then I’ll know I’ve struck the happy medium.
I’ll be a real high-brow in less than no time.”</p>

<p>“You certainly are surprisingly quick,” said Professor
Whalen handsomely. “In a year I could equip you for
our centres of culture, but as I remarked just now it
would not be kind to transform you into an exotic. Now,
suppose we read a few pages of this grammar——”</p>

<p>“I studied grammar at school,” interrupted Ida haughtily.
“What do you take Butte for, anyhow. It may be a
mining camp, and jay enough compared with your old
Boston, but I guess we learn something mor’n the alphabet
at all these big red brick schoolhouses we’ve got—Montana’s
famous for its grand schoolhouses——”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes, my dear Mrs. Compton. But, you know,
one forgets so quickly. And then so many of you don’t<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>
stay in school long enough. How old were you when you
left?”</p>

<p>“Fifteen. Ma wouldn’t let me go to the High.”</p>

<p>“Precisely. Well, I will adhere to my original purpose,
and defer books until our next lesson. Perhaps you
would like me to tell you something more of our Eastern
methods of speech—not only words, but—er—syntax——”</p>

<p>“Oh, hang your old East! You make me feel downright
patriotic.”</p>

<p>Professor Whalen was conscious that it was a distinct
pleasure to make those fine eyes flash. “One would think
we were not all Americans,” he said with a smile.</p>

<p>“Well, I guess you look upon America as East and West
too. Loads of young surveyors and mining men come out
here to make their pile, and at first Montana ain’t good
enough to black their boots, but it soon takes the starch out
of ’em. No use puttin’ on dog here. It don’t work.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I assure you it’s merely a difference of manner—of—er
tradition. We—and I in particular—find your
West most interesting—and significant. I—ah—regard it
as the great furnace under our civilization.”</p>

<p>“And we are the stokers! I like your impudence!”</p>

<p>He had no desire to lose this remunerative pupil, whose
crude mind worked more quickly than his own. She was
now really angry and he made a mild dive in search of
his admitted tact.</p>

<p>“My dear lady, you put words into my mouth that
emanate from your own clever brain, not from my merely
pedantic one. Not only have I the highest respect for the
West, and for Montana in particular, but please remember
that the contempt of the East for the West is merely
passive, negative, when compared with the lurid scorn
of the West for the East. ‘Effete’ is its mildest term of
opprobrium. I doubt if your ‘virile’ Westerner believes us
to be really alive, in a condition to inhabit aught but a
museum. Your men when they ‘make their pile’, or take
a vacation, never dream of going to Boston, seldom, indeed,
to Europe. They take the fastest train for New York—and
by no means with a view to exploring that wilderness
for its oases of culture——”</p>

<p>“Well, I guess not!” cried Ida, her easy good nature
restored. “All-night restaurants, something new in the
way of girls—‘chickens’ and ‘squabs’—musical shows,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>
watchin’ the sun rise—that’s their little old New York.
They always come home shakin’ themselves like a Newfoundland
puppy, or purrin’ like a cat full of cream, but
talkin’ about the Great Free West, God’s Own Country,
and the Big Western Heart. I’ve a friend who does manicurin’,
and she knows ’em like old shoes.”</p>

<p>Whalen, who had a slight cultivated sense of humor,
laughed. “You are indeed most apt and picturesque, dear
Mrs. Compton. But—while I think of it—you mustn’t
drop your final <i>gs</i>. That, I am told, is one of the fashionable
divagations of the British aristocracy. But with us
it is the hallmark of the uneducated. Now, I really have
told you all you can remember for one day, and will take
my leave. It is to be every other day, I understand.
On Wednesday, then, at two?”</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap">IDA walked to the gate with him. She was quite a head
taller than he, but subtly made him feel that the advantage
was his, as it enabled her to pour the light of her
eyes downward. He picked his way up the uneven surface
of East Granite Street, slippery with a recent fall of snow,
not only disturbed, but filled with a new conceit; in other
words thrilling with his first full sense of manhood.</p>

<p>Ida looked after him, smiling broadly. But the smile
fled abruptly, her lips trembled, then contracted. Advancing
down the street was Mrs. Mark Blake. Ida had known
her enterprising young husband before he changed his
name from Mike to Mark, but she knew his lady wife by
sight only; Mrs. Blake had not patronized Madame O’Reilley.
Ruby and Pearl pronounced her “all right”, although
a trifle “proud to look at.” Ida assumed that she was to
receive the promised call, and wished she could “get out
of it.” Not only did she long for her rocker, gum and
magazine, after the intellectual strain of the past hour,
but she had no desire to meet Mrs. Blake or any of “that
crowd” until she could take her place as their equal. She
had her full share of what is known as class-consciousness,
and its peculiar form of snobbery. To be patronized by
“swells”, even to be asked to their parties, would give her
none of that subtle joy peculiar to the climbing snob.
When the inevitable moment came she would burst upon
them, dazzle them, bulldoze and lead them, but she wanted
none of their crumbs.</p>

<p>But she was “in for it.” She hastily felt the back of
her shirtwaist to ascertain if it still were properly adjusted,
and sauntered towards the cottage humming a tune,
pretending not to have seen the lady who stopped to have
a word with Professor Whalen. “Anyhow, she’s not a
bonanzerine,” thought Ida. “I guess she did considerable
scrapin’ at one time; and Mark, for all he could make
shoe-blackin’ look like molasses, ain’t a millionaire yet.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>She might indeed, further reflected Ida, watching the
smartly tailored figure out of the corner of her eye, be
pitied, for she had been “brought up rich, expecting to
marry a duke, and then come down kaplunk before she’d
much more’n a chance to grow up.” Her father, Judge
Stratton, a graduate of Columbia University, had been
one of the most brilliant and unscrupulous lawyers of the
Northwest. He had drawn enormous fees from railroads
and corporations, and in the historic Clark-Daly duels
for supremacy in the State of Montana, and in the more
picturesque battle between F. Augustus Heinze and
“Amalgamated” (that lusty offspring of the great Standard
Oil Trust), when the number of estimable citizens
bought and sold demonstrated the faint impress of time
on original sin, his legal acumen and persuasive tongue,
his vitriolic pen, ever had been at the disposal of the
highest bidder.</p>

<p>He had been a distinguished resident of Butte but a few
years when he built himself a spacious if hideous residence
on the West Side. But this must have been out of
pure loyalty to his adopted state, for it was seldom occupied,
although furnished in the worst style of the late
seventies and early eighties. Mrs. Stratton and her daughter
spent the greater part of their time in Europe. As
Judge Stratton disliked his wife, was intensely ambitious
for his only child, and preferred the comforts of his
smaller home on The Flat, he rarely recalled his legitimate
family, and made them a lavish allowance. He died
abruptly of apoplexy, and left nothing but a life insurance
of five thousand dollars; he had neglected to take out any
until his blood vessels were too brittle for a higher risk.</p>

<p>Mrs. Stratton promptly became an invalid, and Ora
brought her home to Butte, hoping to save something from
the wreck. There was nothing to save. As she had not
known of the life insurance when they received the curt
cablegram in Paris, she had sold all of her mother’s jewels
save a string of pearls, and, when what was left of this
irrelative sum after the luxurious journey over sea and
land, was added to the policy, the capital of these two
still bewildered women represented little more than they
had been accustomed to spend in six months. When Mark
Blake, who had studied law in Judge Stratton’s office
after graduating from the High School, and now seemed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>
to be in a fair way to inherit the business, besides being
County Attorney at the moment, implored Ora to marry
him, and manifested an almost equal devotion to her
mother, whom he had ranked with the queens of history
books since boyhood, she accepted him as the obvious solution
of her problem.</p>

<p>She was lonely, disappointed, mortified, a bit frightened.
She had lived the life of the average American princess,
and although accomplished had specialised in nothing;
nor given a thought to the future. As she had cared little
for the society for which her mother lived, and much for
books, music, and other arts, and had talked eagerly with
the few highly specialised men she was fortunate enough
to meet, she had assumed that she was clever. She also
believed that when she had assuaged somewhat her appetite
for the intellectual and artistic banquet the gifted of
the ages had provided, she might develop a character and
personality, possibly a gift of her own. But she was only
twenty when her indulgent father died, and, still gorging
herself, was barely interested in her capacities other than
receptive, less still in the young men that sought her, unterrified
by her reputation for brains. She fancied that
she should marry when she was about twenty-eight, and
have a salon somewhere; and the fact that love had played
so little a part in her dreams made it easier to contemplate
marriage with this old friend of her childhood. His mother
had been Mrs. Stratton’s seamstress, to be sure, but as he
was a good boy,—he called for the frail little woman every
evening to protect her from roughs on her long walk east
to the cottage her husband had built shortly before he
was blown to pieces somewhere inside of Butte—he had
been permitted to hold the dainty Ora on his knee, or toss
her, gurgling with delight, into the air until he puffed.</p>

<p>Mark had been a fat boy, and was now a fat young man
with a round rosy face and a rolling lazy gait. He possessed
an eye of remarkable shrewdness, however, was making
money rapidly, never lost sight of the main chance, and
was not in the least surprised when his marriage lifted him
to the pinnacle of Butte society. In spite of his amiable
weaknesses, he was honest if sharp, an inalienable friend,
and he made a good husband according to his lights. Being
a man’s man, and naturally elated at his election to the
exclusive Silver Bow Club soon after his marriage to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>
snow maiden of his youthful dreams, he formed the habit
of dropping in for a game of billiards every afternoon on
his way home, and returning for another after dinner.
But within three years he was able to present the wife of
whom he was inordinately proud with a comfortable home
on the West Side, and he made her an allowance of ever
increasing proportions.</p>

<p>Ora, who had her own idea of a bargain, had never complained
of neglect nor intimated that she found anything
in him that savoured of imperfection. She had accepted
him as a provider, and as he filled this part of the contract
brilliantly, she felt that to treat him to scenes whose
only excuse was outraged love or jealousy, would be both
unjust and absurd. Moreover, his growing passion for his
club was an immense relief after his somewhat prolonged
term of marital uxoriousness, and as her mother died almost
coincidentally with the abridgment of Mr. Blake’s
home life, Ora returned to her studies, rode or walked for
hours, and, after her double period of mourning was
over, danced two or three times a week in the season, or
sat out dances when she met a man that had cultivated his
intellect. For women she cared little.</p>

<p>It never occurred to Mark to be jealous of his passionless
wife, although he would have asserted his authority
if she had received men alone in the afternoon. But Ora
paid a scrupulous deference to his wishes in all respects.
She even taught herself to keep house, and her servants
manners as well as the elements of edible cooking. This she
regarded as her proudest feat, for she frankly hated the
domestic details of life; although after three years in a
“Block”,—a sublimated lodging house, peculiar to the
Northwest—she enjoyed the space and privacy of her
home. Mark told his friends that his wife was the most
remarkable woman in Montana, rarely found fault, save in
the purely mechanical fashion of the married male, and
paid the bills without a murmur. Altogether it was a
reasonably happy marriage.</p>

<p>Ora Blake’s attitude to life at this time was expressed
in the buoyancy of her step, the haughty carriage of her
head, the cool bright casual glance she bestowed upon the
world in general. Her code of morals, ethics, manners, as
well as her acceptance of the last set of conditions she
would have picked from the hands of Fate, was summed up<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>
in two words: <i>noblesse oblige</i>. Of her depths she knew as
little as Gregory Compton of his.</p>

<p>“This is Mrs. Compton, I am sure,” she said in her cool
even voice, as she came up behind the elaborately unconscious
and humming Ida. “I am Mrs. Blake.”</p>

<p>“Pleased to meet you,” said Ida formally, extending a
limp hand. “Come on inside.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Blake closed her eyes as she entered the parlour,
but opened them before Ida had adjusted the blower to
the grate, and exclaimed brightly:</p>

<p>“How clever of you to settle so quickly. I shouldn’t
have dared to call for another fortnight, but Mr. Compton
told my husband yesterday that you were quite in order.
It was three months before I dared open my doors.”</p>

<p>“Well,” drawled Ida, rocking herself, “I guess your
friends are more critical than mine. And I guess you
didn’t rely wholly on Butte for your furniture. I had
Ma’s old junk, and the rest cost me just two hundred dollars.”</p>

<p>“How very clever of you!” But although Mrs. Blake
was doing her best to be spontaneous and impressed, Ida
knew instantly that she had committed a solecism, and
felt both angry and apprehensive. She was more afraid
of this young woman than of her professor. Once more
she wished that Mrs. Blake and the whole caboodle would
leave her alone till she was good and ready.</p>

<p>Ora hastened on to a safer topic, local politics.
Butte, tired of grafting politicians, was considering the
experiment of permitting a Socialist of good standing to
be elected mayor. Ida, like all women of the smaller
Western towns, was interested in local politics, and, glad
of the impersonal topic, gave her visitor intelligent encouragement,
the while she examined her critically. She finally
summed her up in the word “pasty”, and at that stage
of Ora Blake’s development the description was not inapt.
She took little or no interest in her looks, although she
dressed well by instinct; and nature, supplemented by her
mother, had given her style. But her hair was almost
colourless and worn in a tight knot just above her neck,
her complexion was weather-beaten, her lips rather pale,
and her body very thin. But when men whose first glance
had been casual turned suddenly, wondering at themselves,
to examine that face so lacking in the potencies of colouring,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>
they discovered that the eyes, deeply set and far
apart, were of a deep dark blazing grey, that the nose was
straight and fine, the ears small, the mouth mobile, with
a slight downward droop at the corners; also that her
hands and feet were very slender, with delicate wrists and
ankles. Ida, too, noted these points, but wondered where
her “charm” came from. She knew that Mrs. Blake possessed
this vague but desirable quality, in spite of her
dread reputation as a “high-brow”, and her impersonal
attitude toward men.</p>

<p>Ruby had informed her that the men agreed she had
charm if she would only condescend to exert it. “And
I can feel it too,” she had added, “every time I do her
nails—she never lets anyone do that hair of hers or give
her a massage, which she needs, the Lord knows. But she’s
got fascination, magnetism, whatever you like to call it,
for all she’s so washed-out. Somehow, I always feel that
if she’d wake up, get on to herself, she’d play the devil
with men, maybe with herself.”</p>

<p>Ida recalled the comments of the wise Miss Miller and
frowned. This important feminine equipment she knew to
be her very own, and although she would have been proud
to admit the rivalry of a beautiful woman, she felt a sense
of mortification in sharing that most subtle and fateful
of all gifts, sex-magnetism, with one so colourless and
plain. That the gifts possessed by this woman talking
with such well-bred indifference of local affairs must be
far more subtle than her own irritated her still more.
It also filled her with a vague sense of menace, almost of
helplessness. Later, when her brain was more accustomed
to analysis, she knew that she had divined—her consciousness
at that time too thick to formulate the promptings of
instinct—that when man is taken unawares he is held more
firmly captive.</p>

<p>Ida, staring into those brilliant powerful eyes, felt a sudden
desperate need to dive through their depths into this
woman’s secret mind, to know her better at once, get rid
of the sense of mystery that baffled and oppressed her. In
short she must know where she was at and know it quick.
It did not strike her until afterward as odd that she should
have felt so intensely personal in regard to a woman whose
sphere was not hers and whose orbit had but just crossed
her own.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>For a time she floundered, but feminine instinct
prompted the intimate note.</p>

<p>“I saw you talkin’—talking to the professor,” she said
casually. “I suppose you know your husband got him
for me.”</p>

<p>“I arranged it myself—” began Mrs. Blake, smiling,
but Ida interrupted her sharply:</p>

<p>“Greg—Mr. Compton didn’t tell me he had talked to
you about it.”</p>

<p>“Nor did he. I have had the pleasure of meeting Mr.
Compton but once—the day I married; he was my husband’s
best man. Mark never can get him to come to the
house, hardly to the club. But my husband naturally
would turn over such a commission to me. I hope you
found the little professor satisfactory.”</p>

<p>“He’ll do, I guess. He knows an awful lot, and I have
a pretty good memory. But to get—and practice—it all—well,
I guess that takes years.” She imbued her tones
with a pathetic wistfulness, and gazed upon her visitor
with ingenuous eyes, brimming with admiration. “It
must be just grand to have got all that education, and
to have lived in Europe while you were growing up. Nothing
later on that you can get is the same, I guess. You look
just about as polished off as I look raw.”</p>

<p>“Oh! No! No!” cried Ora deprecatingly, her cheeks
flooding with a delicate pink that made her look very
young and feminine. She had begun by disliking this
dreadfully common person, but not only was she by no
means as innocent of vanity as she had been trying for
years to believe, but she was almost emotionally swift to
respond to the genuine appeal. And, clever as she was,
it was not difficult to delude her.</p>

<p>“Of course I had advantages that I am grateful for,
but I have a theory that it is never too late to begin.
And you are so young—a few months of our professor—are
you really ambitious?”</p>

<p>“You bet.” Ida committed herself no further at the
moment.</p>

<p>“Then you will enjoy study—expanding and furnishing
your mind. It is a wonderful sensation!” Mrs.
Blake’s eyes were flashing now, her mouth was soft, her
strong little chin with that cleft which always suggests a
whirlpool, was lifted as if she were drinking. “The moment<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>
you are conscious that you are using the magic keys
to the great storehouses of the world, its arts, its sciences,
its records of the past—when you begin to help yourself
with both hands and pack it away in your memory—always
something new—when you realise that the store is inexhaustible—that
in study at least there is no ennui—Oh,
I can give you no idea of what it all means—you will find
it out for yourself!”</p>

<p>“Jimminy!” thought Ida. “I guess not! But that ain’t
where her charm for men comes from, you bet!” Aloud
she said, with awe in her voice:</p>

<p>“No wonder you know so much when you like it like
that. But don’t it make you—well—kinder lonesome?”</p>

<p>“Sometimes—lately——” Mrs. Blake pulled herself up
with a deep blush. “It has meant everything to me, that
mental life, and it always shall!”</p>

<p>The astute Ida noted the defiant ring in her voice, and
plunged in. “I wonder now? Say, you’re a pretty woman
and a young one, and they say men would go head over
ears about you if you’d give ’em a show. You’ve got a
busy husband and so have I. Husbands don’t companion
much and you can’t make me believe learning’s all. Don’t
you wish these American Turks of husbands would let us
have a man friend occasionally? They say that in high
society in the East and in Europe, the women have all
the men come to call on them afternoons they like, but the
ordinary American husband, and particularly out West—Lord!
When a woman has a man call on her, she’s about
ready to split with her husband—belongs to the fast set—and
he’s quail hunting somewheres else. Of course I’ve
known Mark all my life—and you who was—were brought
up in the real world—it must be awful hard on you.
Wouldn’t you like to try your power once in a while, see
how far you could go—just for fun? I guess you’re not
shocked?”</p>

<p>“No, I’m not shocked,” said Ora, laughing. “But I
don’t believe men interest me very much in that way—although,
heaven knows, there are few more delightful
sensations than talking to a man who makes you feel as
if your brain were on fire. I don’t think I care to have
American men, at least, become interested in me in any
other way. In Europe——” She hesitated, and Ida
leaned forward eagerly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>“Oh, do tell me, Mrs. Blake! I don’t know a blamed
thing. I’ve never been outside of Montana.”</p>

<p>“Well—I mean—the American man takes love too seriously.
I suppose it is because he is so busy—he has to
take life so seriously. He specialises intensely. It is all
or nothing with him. Of course I am talking about love.
When they play about, it is generally with a class of
women of which we have no personal knowledge. The
European, with his larger leisure, and generations of
leisure in his brain, his interest in everything, and knowledge
of many things,—above all of the world,—has reduced
gallantry to a fine art. He may give his fancy, his sentiment,
his passion, even his leisure, to one woman at a time,
but his heart—well, unless he is very young—that remains
quite intact. Love is the game of his life with a change of
partner at reasonable intervals. In other words he is far
too accomplished and sophisticated to be romantic. Now,
your American man, although he looks the reverse of romantic,
and is always afraid of making a fool of himself,
when he does fall in love with a woman—say, across a legal
barrier—must annihilate the barrier at once; in other
words, elope or rush to the divorce court. It isn’t that
he is more averse from a liaison than the European, but
more thorough. It is all or nothing. In many respects
he is far finer than the European, but he makes for turmoil,
and, less subtle, he fails to hold our interest.”</p>

<p>“You mean he don’t keep us guessing? Well, you’re
right about most of them. I never saw a boy I couldn’t
read like a page ad., until I met my husband. I thought
I knew him, too, till I’d been married to him awhile.
But, my land, he gets deeper every minute. I guess if
I hadn’t married him he’d have kidnapped me, he was
that gone, and forgetting anything else existed. Of course,
I didn’t expect that to last, but I did think he’d go on
being transparent. But, believe me, the Sphinx ain’t a
patch on him. I sometimes think I don’t know him at all,
and that keeps me interested.”</p>

<p>“I should think it might!” exclaimed Mrs. Blake, thinking
of her own standard possession. “But then Mr. Compton
is a hard student, and is said to have a voracious as
well as a brilliant mind. No doubt that is the secret of
what appears on the surface as complexity and secretiveness.
I know the symptoms!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>“P’raps. But—well, I live with him, and I suspicion
otherwise. I suspect him of having as many kind of leads,
and cross-cuts, and ‘pockets’, and veins full of different
kinds of ore in him as we’ve got right under our feet in
Butte Hill. Do you think”—she spoke with a charming
wistfulness—“that when I know more, have opened up and
let out my top story, as it were, I shall understand him
better?”</p>

<p>And again Ora responded warmly, “Indeed, yes, dear
Mrs. Compton. It isn’t so much what you put into your
mind—it’s more the reflex action of that personal collection
in developing not only the mental faculties, but one’s
intuitions, one’s power to understand others—even one
whose interests are different, or whose knowledge is infinitely
greater than our own.”</p>

<p>“I believe you could even understand Greg!” Ida spoke
involuntarily and stared with real admiration at the
quickened face with its pink cheeks and flashing eyes, its
childish mobile mouth. Ora at the moment looked beautiful.
Suddenly Ida felt as if half-drowned in a wave of
ambiguous terror. She sat up very straight.</p>

<p>“I guess you’re right,” she said slowly. “You’ve made
me see it as the others haven’t. I’ll work at all that measly
little professor gives me, but—I don’t know—somehow, I
can’t think he’ll do much more than make me talk decent.
There’s nothing <i>to</i> him.”</p>

<p>Ora’s heart beat more quickly. Her indifference had
vanished in this intimate hour, also her first subtle dislike
of Ida, who’s commonness now seemed picturesque, and
whose wistful almost complete ignorance had made a strong
appeal to her sympathies. For the first time in her lonely
life she felt that she had something to give. And here
was raw and promising material ready and eager to be
woven, if not into cloth of silver, at least into a quality
of merchandise vastly superior to that which the rude
loom of youth had so far produced. All she knew of
Gregory Compton, moreover, made her believe in and admire
him; the loneliness of his mental life with this woman
appalled her. This was not the first time she had been
forced to admit of late that under the cool bright surface
of her nature were more womanly impulses than formerly,
a spontaneous warmth that was almost like the quickening
of a child; but she had turned from the consciousness with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>
an impatient: “What nonsense! What on earth should
I do with it?” The sense that she was of no vital use
to anyone had discouraged her, dimmed her interest in
her studies. Her husband could hire a better housekeeper,
find a hundred girls who would companion him better.
And what if she were <i>instruite</i>? So were thousands of
women. Nothing was easier.</p>

<p>But this clever girl of the people, who might before
many years had passed be one of the rich and conspicuous
women of the United States, above all, the wife of one of
the nation’s “big men,” working himself beyond human
capacity, harassed, needing not only physical comfort at
home, but counsel, companionship, perfect understanding,—might
it not be her destiny to equip Ida Compton
for her double part? Ora’s imagination, the most precious
and the most dangerous of her gifts, was at white heat.
To her everlasting credit would be the fashioning of a
helpmate for one of her country’s great men. It would be
enough to do as much for the state which her imperfect
father had loved so passionately; but her imagination
would not confine Gregory Compton within the limitations
of a state. It was more than likely that his destiny would
prove to be national; and she had seen the wives of certain
men eminent in political Washington, but of obscure
origin. They were Ida’s mannered, grooved, crystallised;
women to flee from.</p>

<p>She leaned forward and took Ida’s hand in both of
hers. “Dear Mrs. Compton!” she exclaimed. “Do let
me teach you what little I know. I mean of art—history—the past—the
present—I have portfolios of beautiful
photographs of great pictures and scenes that I collected
for years in Europe. It will do me so much good to go
over them. I haven’t had the courage to look at them for
years. And the significant movements, social, political,
religious,—all this theft under so many different names,—Christian
Science, the ‘Uplift’ Movement, Occultism—from
the ancient Hindu philosophy—it would be delightful
to go into it with someone. I am sure I could make it
all most interesting to you.”</p>

<p>“My Gorrd!” thought Ida. “Two of ’em! What am
I let in for?” But the undefined sharp sense of terror
lingered, and she answered when she got her breath,</p>

<p>“I’d like it first rate. The work in this shack is nothing.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>
Mr. Compton leaves first thing in the morning, and
don’t show up till nearly six. The professor’s coming
for an hour every other afternoon. But if I go to your
house I want it understood that I don’t meet anyone else.
I’ve got my reasons.”</p>

<p>“You shall not meet a soul. Can’t you imagine how
sick I am of Butte? We’ll have heavenly times. I was
wondering only the other day of what use was all this
heterogeneous mass of stuff I’d put into my head. But,”
she added gaily, “I know now it was for you to select
from. I am so glad. And—and——” Her keen perceptions
suggested a more purely feminine bait. “You were
with Madame O’Reilley, were you not? I get my things
from a very good dressmaker in New York. Perhaps you
would like to copy some of them?”</p>

<p>“Aw! Would I?” Ida gasped and almost strangled.
For the first time during this the most trying day of
her life she felt wholly herself. “You may just bet your
life I would. I need new duds the worst way, even if I’m
not a West Sider. I’ve been on a ranch for nearly a year
and a half, and although Mr. Compton won’t take me to
any balls, there are the movin’ pictures and the mats—matinees;
<i>and</i> the street, where I have to show up once in
a while! I used to think an awful lot of my looks and
style, and I guess it’s time to begin again. I can sew first
rate, make any old thing. Do you mean it?”</p>

<p>“Indeed I do! I <i>want</i> to be of help to you in every
way.” She rose and held Ida’s hand once more in hers,
although she did not kiss her as another woman might have
done. “Will you come tomorrow—about two?”</p>

<p>“You may bet your bottom dollar I’ll come. I haven’t
thanked you, but maybe I’ll do that some other way.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I shouldn’t wonder,” said Mrs. Blake lightly.</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap">BUTTE, “the richest hill in the world” (known at a period
when less famous for metals and morals as
“Perch of the Devil”), is a long scraggy ridge of granite
and red and grey dirt rising abruptly out of a stony uneven
plain high in the Rocky Mountains. The city is
scooped out of its south slope, and overflows upon The
Flat. Big Butte, an equally abrupt protuberance, but
higher, steeper, more symmetrical, stands close beside the
treasure vault, but with the aloof and somewhat cynical
air of even the apocryphal volcano. On all sides the
sterile valley heaves away as if abruptly arrested in a throe
of the monstrous convulsion that begat it; but pressing
close, cutting the thin brilliant air with its icy peaks, is
an irregular and nearly circular chain of mountains, unbroken
white in winter, white on the blue enamelled slopes
in summer.</p>

<p>For nearly half the year the whole scene is white, with
not a tree, nor, beyond the straggling town itself, a house
to break its frozen beauty. It is only when the warm
Chinook wind roars in from the west and melts the snow
much as lightning strikes, or when Summer herself has
come, that you realize the appalling surface barrenness
of this region devastated for many years by the sulphur
and arsenic fumes of ore roasted in the open or belching
from the smelters. They ate up the vegetation, and the
melting snows and heavy June rains washed the weakened
earth from the bones of valley and mountain, leaving both
as stark as they must have been when the earth ceased
to rock and began to cool. Since the smelters have gone
to Anaconda, patches of green, of a sad and timid tenderness,
like the smile of a child too long neglected, have appeared
between the sickly grey boulders of the foothills,
and, in Butte, lawns as large as a tablecloth have been cultivated.
Anaconda Hill at the precipitous eastern end of
the city, with its tangled mass of smokestacks, gallows-frames,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>
shabby grey buildings, trestles, looks like a gigantic
shipwreck, but is merely the portal to the precious ore
bodies of the mines whose shafts, levels, and cross-cuts to
the depth of three thousand feet and more, pierce and
ramify under city and valley. These hideous buildings
through which so many hundreds of millions have passed,
irrupt into the very back yards of some of the homes, built
too far east (and before mere gold and silver gave place to
copper); but the town improves as it leaps westward.
The big severe solid buildings to be found in every modern
city sure of its stability crowd the tumble-down wood
structures of a day when no man looked upon Butte as
aught but a camp. And although the streets are vociferously
cobbled, the pavements are civilised here and there.</p>

<p>Farther west the houses of the residence section grow
more and more imposing, coinciding with the sense of
Butte’s inevitableness. On the high western rim of the
city (which exteriorly has as many ups and downs as
the story of its vitals) stands the red School of Mines.
It has a permanent expression of surprise, natural to a
bit of Italian renaissance looking down upon Butte.</p>

<p>Some of the homes, particularly those of light pressed
brick, and one that looks like the northeast corner of the
upper story of a robber stronghold of the middle ages, are
models of taste and not too modest symbols of wealth; but
north and south and east and west are the snow wastes
in winter and the red or grey untidy desert of sand and
rock in summer.</p>

<p>But if Butte is the ugliest city in the United States, she
knows how to make amends. She is alive to her finger-tips.
Her streets, her fine shops, her hotels, her great office
buildings, are always swarming and animated. At no time,
not even in the devitalised hours that precede the dawn,
does she sink into that peace which even a metropolis welcomes.
She has the jubilant expression of one who coins
the very air, the thin, sparkling, nervous air, into shining
dollars, and, confident in the inexhaustible riches beneath
her feet, knows that she shall go on coining them forever.
Even the squads of miners, always, owing to the three
shifts, to be seen on the street corners, look satisfied and
are invariably well-dressed. Not only do these mines with
their high wages and reasonable hours draw the best class
of workingmen, but there are many college men in them,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>
many more graduates from the High Schools of Montana.
The “Bohunks,” or “dark men,” an inferior class of
Southern Europeans, who live like pigs and send their
wages home, rarely if ever are seen in these groups.</p>

<p>And if Butte be ugly, hopelessly, uncompromisingly
ugly, her compensation is akin to that of many an heiress:
she never forgets that she is the richest hill in the world.
Even the hard grip of the most unassailable trust in
America, which has absorbed almost as much of Montana’s
surface as of its hidden treasure, does not interfere with
her prosperity or supreme complacency. And although she
has her pestilential politicians, her grafters and crooks,
and is so tyrannically unionized that the workingman
groans under the yoke of his brother and forgets to curse
the trust, yet ability and talent make good as always; and
in that electrified city of permanent prosperity there is a
peculiar condition that offsets its evils: it is a city of
sudden and frequent vacancies. New York, Europe, above
all, California, swarm with former Montanans, particularly
of Butte, who have coppered their nests, and transplanted
them with a still higher sense of achievement.</p>

<p>Ora was thinking of Butte and the world beyond Butte,
as she splashed along through the suddenly melted snow
toward her home on the West Side. The Chinook, loud
herald from Japan, had swept down like an army in the
night and turned the crisp white streets to rivers of
mud. But Ora wore stout walking boots, and her short
skirt, cut by a master hand, was wide enough to permit
the impatient stride she never had been able to modify
in spite of her philosophy and the altitude. She walked
several miles a day and in all weathers short of a blizzard;
but not until the past few weeks with the admission that
her increasing restlessness, her longing for Europe, was
growing out of bonds. She wondered today if it were
Europe she wanted, or merely a change.</p>

<p>She had, of course, no money of her own, and never had
ceased to be grateful that her husband’s prompt and generous
allowance made it unnecessary to ask alms of him.
Three times since her marriage he had suddenly presented
her with a check for several hundred dollars and told
her to “give her nerves a chance” either down “on the
coast,” or in New York. She had always fled to New
York, remained a month or six weeks, gone day and night<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>
to opera, theatre, concerts, art exhibitions, not forgetting
her tailor and dressmaker; returning to Butte as refreshed
as if she had taken her heart and nerves, overworked by
the altitude, down to the poppy fields of Southern California.</p>

<p>Her vacations and her husband’s never coincided. Mark
always departed at a moment’s notice for Chicago or New
York, alleging pressing business. He returned, after
equally pressing delays, well, complacent, slightly apologetic.</p>

<p>Ora knew that she had but to ask permission to spend the
rest of the winter in New York, for not only was Mark the
most indulgent of husbands, but he was proud of his
wife’s connections in the American Mecca, not unwilling to
read references in the Butte newspapers to her sojourn
among them. The “best people” of these Western towns
rarely have either friends or relatives in the great cities
of the East. The hardy pioneer is not recruited from the
aristocracies of the world, and the dynamic men and
women that have made the West what it is have the blood
of the old pioneers in them.</p>

<p>Ora was one of the few exceptions. Her father had been
the last of a distinguished line of jurists unbroken since
Jonathan Stratton went down with Alexander Hamilton
in the death struggle between the Federal and the new
Republican party. Ora’s mother, one of New York’s imported
beauties for a season, who had languished theretofore
on the remnants of a Louisiana plantation, impecunious
and ambitious, but inexperienced and superficially imaginative,
married the handsome and brilliant lawyer for
love, conceiving that it would be romantic to spend a few
years in a mining camp, where she, indubitably, would be
its dominant lady. Butte did not come up to her ideas of
romance. Nor had she found it possible to dislodge the
passively determined women with the pioneer blood in their
veins. The fumes afflicted her delicate lungs, the altitude
her far more delicate nerves. Judge Stratton deposited
her in the drawing-room of an eastern bound train with
increasing relish. Had it not been for his little girl he
would have bade her upon the second or third of these
migrations to establish herself in Paris and return no more.</p>

<p>During these long pilgrimages Ora, even while attending
school in New York, Paris, Berlin, Rome, Vevey, had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>
seen something of society, for Mrs. Stratton was ever surrounded
by it, and did not approve of the effect of boarding
school diet on the complexion. But the ardours of her
mind, encouraged always by her father, who never was too
busy to write to her, had made her indifferent to the advantages
prized by Mrs. Stratton.</p>

<p>Today she was conscious of a keen rebellious desire for
something more frivolous, light, exciting, than had entered
her life for many a year. There can be little variety
and no surprises in the social life of a small community—for
even scandal and divorce grow monotonous—and although
she could always enjoy an hour’s intellectual companionship
with the professors of the School of Mines,
whenever it pleased her to summon them, Ora, for the first
time in her twenty-six years, had drifted into a condition
of mind where intellectual revels made no appeal to her
whatever.</p>

<p>She had wondered before this if her life would have
been purely mental had her obligations been different,
but had dismissed the thought as not only dangerous but
ungrateful. She had reason to go on her knees to her
intellect, its ambitions and its furniture, for without it
life would have been insupportable. She ordered her
quickening ego back to the rear, or the depths, or wherever
it bided its time, none too amenable; she was only beginning
to guess the proportions it might assume if encouraged;
the vague phantoms floating across her mind,
will-o’-the-wisps in a fog bank, frightened her. Several
months since she had set her lips, and her mind the task
of acquiring the Russian language. It had always been
her experience that nothing compared with a new language
as a mental usurper.</p>

<p>She had entered into a deliberate partnership with a
man who protected and supported her, and she would keep
the letter, far as its spirit might be beyond the reach of
her will. Even were she to become financially independent,
it was doubtful if she would leave him for a long period;
and for New York and its social diversions she cared not
at all. What she wanted was adventure—she stumbled on
the word, and stopped with a gasp. Adventure. For the
first time she wished she were a man. She would pack two
mules with a prospector’s outfit and disappear into the
mountains.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>She swung her mind to the Russian grammar, enough
to impale it in the death agony; but when she had entered
her home, and, after a visit to her leisurely cook, who was
a unionized socialist, ascended to her bedroom and stood
before her mirror, she decided that it was her singular
interview with the wife of Gregory Compton that had
thrown her mind off its delicate balance. She recalled
that Mrs. Compton—certainly an interesting creature in
spite of her appalling commonness—had told her flagrantly
that she was young, pretty, and attractive to men,
even as are young and pretty women without too much
brains. The compliment—or was it the suggestion?—had
thrilled her, and it thrilled her again. Men sometimes
had tried to make love to her, but she had ascribed such
charm as she appeared to possess to the automatically
vibrating magnet of youth; and although she had never
been above a passing flirtation, either in her mother’s salon
or in Butte, she merely had been bored if the party of
the other part had taken his courage in his hands on the
morrow. Scruples did not trouble her. The American
woman, she would have reasoned, is traditionally “cold.”
American men, brought up on her code of ethics, are able
to take care of themselves.</p>

<p>Had she been superficial in her conclusions? Could she
attract men more potently than by a merely girlish charm
and a vivacious mind? Her memory ran rapidly over
the functions of the winter, particularly the dinners and
dances. She could not recall a passing conquest. She was
angry to feel herself shiver, but she jerked off her hat, and
the pins out of her fine abundant hair. She was twenty-six.
Had she gone off? Faded? She never had been called a
beauty, never had had the vanity to think herself a beauty,
but she remembered that sometimes in an animated company
she had glanced into the passing mirror and thought
herself quite pretty, with her pink cheeks and sparkling
eyes. But normally she was too washed-out for beauty,
however good her features might be, and of course she had
no figure at all. She dressed well from force of habit, and
she had the carriage at least to set off smartly cut garments,
but as much might be said of a dressmaker’s
“form.”</p>

<p>And her skin was sallow and sunburned and weather-beaten
and dry, as any neglected skin in a high altitude is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>
sure to be. Once it had been as white as her native snows.
Her hair, also the victim of the high dry air, and exposed to
the elements for hours together, was more colourless than
Nature had made it—dull—dead. She held out a strand in
dismay, remembering how her <i>cendré</i> hair had been admired
in Paris; then with a sudden sense of relief (it escaped
from the cellar where her ego was immured on
bread and water) she informed herself that it was her
duty to invoke the services of Miss Ruby Miller. No
woman with proper pride—or self-respect—would let her
skin go to pot, no, not at any age; certainly not at twenty-six.
She recalled an impulsive remark of Miss Miller’s
a few months since when arranging her hair for a fancy-dress
ball, and gave another sigh—of hope.</p>

<p>So does Nature avenge herself.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">SHE heard her husband’s voice as he entered the house,
and hastily changed her walking suit for one of the
soft tea gowns she wore when they were alone. This was
a simple thing of a Copenhagen-blue silk, with a guimpe of
fine white net, and trimmed about the neck and half sleeves
with the newest and softest of the year’s laces. She
noticed with some satisfaction that her neck, below the collar
line, was very white; and she suddenly covered the rest
of it with powder, then rubbed the puff over her face. It
was ordinary “baby powder” for the bath, for she never
had indulged in toilet accessories, but it answered its purpose,
if only to demonstrate what she might have been had
she safeguarded the gifts of nature. And the dull blue
gown was suddenly becoming.</p>

<p>Her husband, who had spent the intervening time in the
library, ran upstairs whistling in spite of his girth—he
was the lightest dancer in Butte—and knocked on her
door before going to his own room.</p>

<p>“Say,” he said, as he chucked her under the chin, and
kissed her maritally, “but you look all right. Run down
stairs and hold your breath until I’ve made myself beautiful.
I’ve got big news for you.”</p>

<p>She rustled softly down the stair, wondering what the
news might be, but not unduly interested. Mark was always
excited over his new cases. Perhaps he had been
retained by Amalgamated. She hoped so. He deserved it,
for he worked harder than anyone knew. And she liked
him sincerely, quite without mitigation now that the years
had taught him the folly of being in love with her.</p>

<p>And he certainly had given her a pretty home. The
house was not large enough to be pointed out by the conductor
of the “Seeing Butte Car,” but it had been designed
by a first rate architect, and had a certain air of
spaciousness within. Mrs. Stratton had furnished a flat in
Paris two years before her husband’s death, her excuse<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>
being that the interior of the Butte house got on her
nerves, and there was no other way to take in household
goods free of duty. Ora had shipped them when the news
of her father’s death and their own poverty came, knowing
that she would get a better price for the furniture in
Butte, where someone always was building, than in
Paris.</p>

<p>Before it arrived she had made up her mind to marry
Mark Blake, and although it was several years before they
had a house she kept it in storage. In consequence her
little drawing-room with its gay light formal French furniture
was unique in Butte, city of substantial and tasteful
(sometimes) but quite unindividual homes. Mark was
thankful that he was light of foot, less the bull in the
china shop than he looked, and would have preferred red
walls, an oriental divan and Persian rugs. He felt more
at home in the library, a really large room lined from
floor to ceiling not only with Ora’s but Judge Stratton’s
books, which Mark had bought for a song at the auction;
and further embellished with deep leather chairs and
several superb pieces of carved Italian furniture. Ora
spent the greater part of her allowance on books, and
many hours of her day in this room. But tonight she
deliberately went into the frivolous French parlour, turned
on all the lights, and sat down to await her husband’s
reappearance.</p>

<p>Mark, who had taken kindly to the idea of dressing for
dinner, came running downstairs in a few moments.</p>

<p>“In the doll’s house?” he called out, as he saw the illumination
in the drawing-room. “Oh, come on into a real
room and mix me a cocktail.”</p>

<p>“It isn’t good for you to drink cocktails so long before
eating; Huldah, who receives ‘The People’s War Cry’ on
Monday, informed me that dinner would be half an hour
late.”</p>

<p>“I wish you’d chuck that wooden-faced leaden-footed
apology for a servant. This is the third time——”</p>

<p>“And get a worse? Butte rains efficient servants!
Please sit down. I—<i>feel</i> like this room tonight. You may
smoke.”</p>

<p>“Thanks. I believe this is the first time you have given
me permission. But I’m bound to say the room suits
you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>Ora sat in a <i>chaise-longue</i> of the XV<sup>me</sup> Siècle, a piece of
furniture whose awkward grace gives a woman’s arts full
scope. Much exercise had preserved the natural suppleness
of Ora’s body and she had ancestral memories of all
arts and wiles. Mark seated himself on the edge of a stiff
little sofa covered with faded Aubusson tapestry, and
hunched his shoulders.</p>

<p>“If the French women furnish their rooms like this I
don’t believe all that’s said about them,” he commented
wisely. “Men like to be comfortable even when they’re
looking at a pretty woman.”</p>

<p>“Mama let me choose the furniture for this room,
and I wasn’t thinking much about your sex at the time.
I—I think it expressed a side of me that I wasn’t conscious
of then.”</p>

<p>“It’s a pretty room all right.” Mark lit the consolatory
cigarette. “But not to sit in. What struck you tonight?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’d been thinking of Paris.”</p>

<p>Mark’s face was large and round and bland; it was only
when he drew his brows together that one saw how small
and sharp his eyes were.</p>

<p>“H’m. I’ve wondered sometimes if you weren’t hankering
after Europe. I suppose it gets into the blood.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, it gets into the blood!” Ora spoke lightly, but
she was astonished at his insight.</p>

<p>“I’ve never been able to send you—not as you were
used to going—I don’t see you doing anything on the
cheap——”</p>

<p>“Oh, my dear Mark, you are goodness itself. I’ve
thought very little about it, really.”</p>

<p>“Suppose you found yourself suddenly rich, would
you light out and leave me?”</p>

<p>“We’d go together. It would be great fun being your
cicerone.”</p>

<p>“No chance! I’m going to be a rich man inside the
next ten years, and here I stick. And I don’t see myself
travelling on a woman’s money, either. But I suppose
you’d be like all the rest if you could afford it?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t know. Of course I look forward to spending
a year in Europe once more—I’d hardly be human if
I didn’t. But I can wait for you.”</p>

<p>“I’ve always admired your philosophy,” he said grimly.
“And now I’ve got a chance to put it to a real test. I believe<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>
you are in a way, if not to be rich, at least to make
a pretty good haul.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean?” Ora sat up straight.</p>

<p>“Your father made a good many wild-cat investments
when he first came out here, and the one he apparently
thought the worst, for I found no mention of it among his
papers, was the Oro Fino Primo mine, which he bought
from a couple of sharks in the year you were born—that’s
where you got your name, I guess. One of the men
was a well known prospector and the Judge thought he
was safe. The ore assayed about eighty dollars a ton, so
he took over the claim, paid the Lord knows how much
to the prospector, who promptly lit out, had it patented,
and set a small crew to work under a manager. They
found nothing but low grade ore, which in those days
roused about as much enthusiasm as country rock. The
mine had been salted, of course. It was some time before
your father would give up, and he spent more than the
necessary amount of money to perfect the patent; always
hoping. When he was finally convinced there was nothing
in it he quit. And it was characteristic of your father
that when he quit he quit for good. He simply dismissed
the thing from his mind. Well, times have changed since
then. New processes and more railroads have caused fortunes
to be made out of low grade ore when there is enough
of it. Some people would rather have a big lode of low
grade ore than a pockety vein of rich quartz. As you
know, abandoned mines are being leased all over the state,
and abandoned prospect holes investigated. Well, there
you are. This morning two mining engineers from New
York came into my office with a tale of woe. They came
out here to look about, and after considerable travel within
a reasonable distance of railroads found an old prospect
hole with a shaft sunk about fifty feet. It looked abandoned
all right, but as the dump was still there and they
liked the looks of it they went to the De Smet ranch house—the
hole is just over the border of Greg’s ranch—and
made inquiries. Oakley, who is a monomaniac on the
subject of intensive farming and doesn’t know a mine
from a gopher hole, told them that the adjacent land belonged
to no one but the government. So they staked their
claim, recorded it in Virginia City, retimbered the shaft
and sank it twenty feet deeper. They began to take out<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>
ore that looked good for fifteen dollars a ton. Then along
comes an old prospector and tells them the story of the
mine. They leave their two miners on the job and post
up to Helena to have the records examined in the Land
Office. There, sure enough, they find that the mine was
duly patented by Judge Stratton, and all of the government
requirements complied with. So they come to me.
They want a bond and lease for three years—which means
they may have the privilege of buying at the end of the
lease—and offer you ten per cent. on the net proceeds. I
haven’t given them my answer yet, for I’m going to take
Greg out there next Sunday and have a look at it. There
was a sort of suppressed get-rich-quickishness in their
manner, and their offer was not what you would call
munificent. Greg is a born geologist, to say nothing of
his training. I don’t mean so much in the School of
Mines, but he was always gophering about with old prospectors,
and ran away into the mountains several times
when his father was alive. Never showed up all summer.
He’s at ore now every spare moment he gets, and is as
good an assayer as there is in the state. If there’s mineral
on his own ranch he’ll find it, and if there isn’t he’ll find
it elsewhere. So, I do nothing till he’s looked the property
over. But in any case I think I can promise you a good
lump of money.”</p>

<p>Ora’s breath was short. Her face had been scarlet for
a few moments but now showed quite pale under the tan
and powder. When her husband finished, however, and she
replied, “How jolly,” her voice was quite steady.</p>

<p>“And shall you fly off and leave me if it pans out?”</p>

<p>“Of course not. What do you take me for?”</p>

<p>“To tell you the truth it will mean a good deal to me
if you stay until the fall. I’ve a client coming out here
from New York whom I am trying to persuade to buy the
old Iron Hat mine. There’s a fortune in it for anyone
with money enough to spend rebuilding the old works
and putting in new machinery and timbers; and a big
rake-off for me, if I put the deal through. Well, this
client figures to bring his wife and daughter, and you
could help me a lot—persuade them they’d have the time
of their lives if they spent several months of every year
out here for a while—he’s a domestic sort of man. After
that take a flyer if you like. You deserve it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>“How nice of you! Here is dinner at last.” Ora felt
almost physically sick, so dazzling had been the sudden
prospect of deliverance, followed by the certainty, even before
her husband asked for the diplomatic assistance she
so often had given him, that she could not take advantage
of it. Noblesse oblige! For the moment she hated her
watchword.</p>

<p>She mixed a cocktail with steady hand. “I’ll indulge in
a perfect orgie of clothes!” she said gaily. “And import
a chef. By the way,” she added, as she seated herself at
the table and straightened the knives and forks beside her
plate, “what do you think I let myself in for today?”</p>

<p>“Not been speculating? There’s a quart of Worcestershire
in this soup.”</p>

<p>“I’ll certainly treat you to a chef. No, not speculating—I
wonder if it mightn’t be that? I called on your
friend’s wife——”</p>

<p>“Good girl! She’s not your sort, but she’s Greg’s
wife——”</p>

<p>“I thought she was quite terrible at first, but I soon
became interested. She’s clever in her way, ignorant as
she is, and has individuality. Before I knew it I had
offered to take a hand in her education——”</p>

<p>“Good lord! What sort of a hand?”</p>

<p>“Oh, just showing her my portfolios, giving her some
idea of art. It sounds very elemental, but one must begin
somewhere. She knows so little that it will be like teaching
a child a b c.”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid it will bore you.”</p>

<p>“No, I like the idea. It is something new, and change
is good for the soul. I have an idea that I shall continue
to find her as interesting as I intend she shall find the ‘lessons’.”</p>

<p>“She’ll get more than lessons on art. She’ll get a good
tone down, and she needs that all right. Poor old Greg!
He deserved the best and he got Ida Hook. I tried to
head him off but I might as well have tried to head off
a stampede to a new gold diggings. He ought to have
married a lady, that’s what.”</p>

<p>Ora glanced up quickly, then, thankful that her husband
was intent upon his carving, dropped her eyes. It was the
first time he had ever hinted at the differences of class. In
his boyhood there had been a mighty gulf between his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>
mother and the haughty Mrs. Stratton who employed her
in what was then the finest house in Butte. But he was
too thoroughly imbued with the spirit of the West, in
which he had spent his life, to recognise any difference in
class save that which was determined by income. As soon
as his own abilities, industry, and the turn of Fortune’s
wheel, placed him in a position to offer support to the two
dainty women that had been his ideals from boyhood,
he knew himself to be their equal, without exhausting himself
in analysis.</p>

<p>As for Ora, the West was quick in her blood, in spite
of her heritage and education. Her father had assumed
the virtue of democracy when he settled in Montana. In
the course of a few years a genuine liking and enthusiasm
for his adopted state, as well as daily associations, transformed
him into as typical a Westerner as the West ever
turned out of her ruthless crucible. He even wore a Stetson
hat when he visited New York. His wife’s “airs” had
inspired him with an increasing disgust which was one of
the most honest emotions of his life, and the text of his repeated
warnings to his daughter, whom he was forced to
leave to the daily guidance of his legal wife (Ora’s continued
presence in Butte, would, in truth, have caused
him much embarrassment), had been to cherish her Western
birthright as the most precious of her possessions.</p>

<p>“Remember this is the twentieth century,” he had written
to her not long before his death. “There is no society
in the world today that cannot be invaded by a combination
of money, brains, and a certain social talent—common
enough. The modern man, particularly in the United
States, makes himself. His ancestors count for nothing,
if he doesn’t. If he does they may be a good asset, for
they (possibly) have given him breeding ready-made,
moral fibre, and a brain of better composition than the
average man of the people can expect. But that is only
by the way. The two most potent factors in the world
today are money and the waxing, rising, imperishable democratic
spirit. That was reborn out here in the West, and
the West is invading and absorbing the East. The old un-American
social standards of the East are expiring in the
present generation, which resort to every absurdity to maintain
them; its self-consciousness betraying its recognition
of the inevitable. Twenty years hence this class will be, if<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>
still clinging to its spar, as much of a national joke as
the Western women were when they first flashed their
diamonds in Peacock Alley. That phase, you may notice,
is so dead that the comic papers have forgotten it. The
phase was inevitable, but our women are now so accustomed
to their money that they are not to be distinguished
from wealthy women anywhere except that their natural
hospitality and independence make them seem more sure
of themselves. Of course the innately vulgar are to be
found everywhere, and nowhere more abundantly than
in New York.</p>

<p>“Twenty years from now, the West will have overrun
the East; it will have helped itself with both hands to all
the older civilisation has to give, and it will have made
New York as democratic as Butte—or London! So don’t
let yourself grow up with any old-fashioned nonsense in
your head. I want you to start out in life modern to the
core, unhampered by any of the obsolete notions that make
your mother and most of our relations a sort of premature
has-beens. When your time comes to marry, select a Western
man who either has made his own fortune or has the
ability to make it. Don’t give a thought to his origin if
his education is good, and his manners good enough. You
can supply the frills. I wouldn’t have you marry a man
that lacked the fundamentals of education at least, but
better that than one whose brain is so full of old-fashioned
ideas that it has no room for those that are born every
minute. And I hope you will settle here in this state and
do something for it, either through the abilities of the man
you marry or with your own. It isn’t only the men that
build up a new state. And if you marry a foreigner never
let me see nor hear from you again. They are all very
well in their way, but it is not our way.”</p>

<p>Ora, who had worshipped her father and admired him
above all men, never forgot a word he uttered, and knew
his letters by heart. Possibly it was the memory of this
last of his admonitions which had enabled her to sustain
the shock of a proposal from the son of her mother’s old
seamstress and of a miner who had died in his overalls
underground. It is doubtful if she would have been conscious
of the shock had it not been for Mrs. Stratton’s
lamentations. That lady from her sofa in one of the
humbler Blocks, had sent wail after wail in the direction<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>
of the impertinent aspirant. Ora, during the brief period
in which she made her decision, heard so much about the
“bluest blood of the South,” and the titled foreigners
whom she apparently could have had for the accepting
when she was supposed to belong to the Millionaire Sisterhood,
that she began to ponder upon the violent contrasts
embodied in Mark with something like rapture. After
the marriage was accomplished, Mrs. Stratton had the
grace to wail in solitude, and shortly after moved on to a
world where only the archangels are titled and never have
been known to marry. Ora had not given the matter another
thought. Mark had been carefully brought up by a
refined little woman, his vicious tendencies had been negligible,
and he was too keen to graduate from the High
School and make his start in life to waste time in even
the milder forms of dissipation. When he married he
adapted himself imperceptibly to the new social world he
entered; if not a Beau Brummel, nor an Admirable Crichton,
he never would disgrace his aristocratic wife; and,
unlike Judge Stratton, he wore a silk hat in New York.</p>

<p>His last remark apparently had been a mere vapour from
his subconscious mind, for he went on as soon as he had
taken the edge from his appetite, “Perhaps Ida Hook can
be made into one. I’ve seen waitresses and chambermaids
metamorphosed by a million or two so that their own husbands
wouldn’t recognise them if they stayed away too
long. But it takes time, and Ida has an opinion of herself
that would make an English duchess feel like a slag dump.
Say—do you know it was through me Greg met her? It
was that week you were out on the Kelley ranch. I met
two or three of the old crowd on the street and nothing
would do but that I should go to their picnic for the sake
of old times. Greg was in town and I persuaded him to
come along. Didn’t want to, but I talked him over. Guess
there’s no escaping our fate. Possibly I couldn’t have
corralled him if it hadn’t been for reaction—he’d been
whooping it up on The Flat. Well, I wished afterward
that I’d left him to play the wheel and all the rest of it
for a while longer. Greg never loses his head—that is to
say he never did till he met Ida Hook. The sporting life
never took a hold on him, for while he went in for it with
the deep deliberation that was born in him, it’s just that
deliberation that saves him from going too far. He cuts<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>
loose the minute he figured out beforehand to cut loose,
and all the king’s horses—or all the other attractions—couldn’t
make him put in another second. A girl shot
herself one night out at the Five Mile House because he
suddenly said good-bye and turned on his heel. She knew
he meant it. He never even turned round when he heard
her drop——”</p>

<p>“What a brute!”</p>

<p>“Greg? Not he. I’ve known him to sit up all night
with a sick dog——”</p>

<p>“I hate people that are kind to animals and cruel to one
another.”</p>

<p>“Greg isn’t cruel. He said he was going and he went;
that’s all. It’s his way. Girls of that kind are trash,
anyhow, and when a woman goes into the sporting life she
knows enough to take sporting chances.”</p>

<p>“You are as bad as he.”</p>

<p>Mark stared at her in open-eyed amazement. He never
had seen her really roused before. “Don’t you bother your
dear little head,” he said soothingly. “Angels like you
don’t know anything about that sort of life—and don’t
need to.”</p>

<p>Ora’s anger vanished in laughter. “Well, suppose you
give me a hint about his wife. I really am interested,
and delighted at the prospect of being of some use in the
world.”</p>

<p>“You’re all right! Ida—well, I guess you’ll do a lot
for her, by just having her round. She’s no fool—and she
certainly is a looker. If you tone her down and polish
her up I’ll feel it’s a sort of favour to myself. Greg’ll be
one of the richest men in this country some day,—if he has
to walk over a few thousand fellow citizens to get there—and
I don’t want to see him queered by a woman. Seen
that before.”</p>

<p>“I intend to do my best, but for her sake, not his——”</p>

<p>“Say!” It was patent that Mark had an inspiration.
“Why not take Ida with you to Europe? I don’t like the
idea of a dainty little thing like you” (Ora was five feet
six) “travelling alone, and a husky girl like Ida could take
care of you while putting on a few coats of European
polish. Greg can afford it; he must have cleared a good
many thousands on his ranch during the last two years,
besides what I’ve turned over for him; and he can live<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>
here with me and get all the comforts of home. I’ll let you
off for six months. What do you say?”</p>

<p>Ora was looking at him with pink cheeks and bright
eyes. “You are sure you won’t mind?”</p>

<p>“I’ll miss you like fun, of course; especially when you
look as pretty as you do this minute, but I think it would
be a good thing for you and better for Ida—and I’ll fire
this cook.”</p>

<p>“Will Mr. Compton give his consent?”</p>

<p>“No one on God’s earth would take chances on what
Gregory Compton would do until he had done it, but I
don’t mind throwing a guess that he could live without
Ida for six months and not ask me to dry his tears. And
there isn’t a mean bone in his body.”</p>

<p>“It would interest me immensely to take Mrs. Compton
abroad. Now hurry if you expect to get a seat at one of
the bridge tables. It is late——”</p>

<p>“I rather thought I’d like to stay and talk to you——”</p>

<p>“How polite of you! But I’m tired out and going
straight to bed. So toddle along.”</p>

<p class="drop-cap">“TAILORED suits have to be made by a tailor, but I’d
like first rate to copy this one you call a little afternoon
frock. It’s got the style all right, and I could get
some cheap nice-looking stuff.”</p>

<p>Ida was gloating over Ora’s limited but fashionable
wardrobe, and while she held the smart afternoon frock
out at arm’s length, her eye wandered to an evening gown
of blue satin and chiffon that lay over the back of a chair.</p>

<p>“Glory!” she sighed. “But I’d like to wear a real
gown like that. Low-neck, short sleeves! I’ve got the neck
and arms too, you bet——”</p>

<p>“Why not copy it?” Ora was full of enthusiasm once
more. “You can do it here, and I have an excellent seamstress——”</p>

<p>“Where’d I wear a rig like that? Even if I made it
in China silk and Greg took me anywheres, I couldn’t.
We don’t go in for real low necks in our bunch.”</p>

<p>“But surely you’ll go to the Junior Prom?”</p>

<p>Ida opened her mouth as well as her eyes. “The Junior
Prom? I never thought of it. Of course I’d be asked,
Greg being in the Junior Class and all——”</p>

<p>“Naturally.”</p>

<p>Ida frowned. “Well, I ain’t going. I said I wouldn’t
go anywheres—to any swell blowouts, until I’m as big as
anybody there.”</p>

<p>“But the School of Mines is composed of young men
of all classes. Each asks his friends. The Prom is anything
but an exclusive affair. You go out to the Garden
dances on Friday nights in summer?”</p>

<p>“Oh, in that jam—and everybody wearing their suits,
or any old thing——”</p>

<p>“Well, I think you should go to the Prom. Mr. Compton
is the star pupil in the School of Mines. The professors
talk of no one else. I rather think your absence would
cause comment.”</p>

<p>“Well—maybe I’ll go. I’d like to all right. But I
can’t wear low-neck. I guess you know it wouldn’t do.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>“No doubt you are right.” Ora made no attempt at
conversion; it was encouraging that Ida had certain inclinations
toward good taste, even if they were prompted
by expediency.</p>

<p>“Jimminy, but your room’s pretty!” exclaimed Ida.
“Mine’s pink—but lawsy!”</p>

<p>She gazed about the room, which, although she never had
seen the sea, recalled descriptions of its shells washed by
its foam. She knit her brows. “I guess it takes experience,
and seein’ things,” she muttered. Her eyes travelled
to the little bed in one corner. It would have looked like
a nun’s, so narrow and inconspicuous was it, had it not
been for its cover of pale pink satin under the same
filmy lace.</p>

<p>“Sakes alive!” she exclaimed. “Don’t you sleep with
your husband?”</p>

<p>Ora was angry to feel herself coloring. She answered
haughtily, “We have separate rooms. It is the custom—I
mean—I have always seen——”</p>

<p>“I’ve heard it was the stunt among swells, but I don’t
hold to it. It’s only at night that you’ve really got a
chance to know where a man is; and the more rope you
give him the more he’ll take. What’s to prevent Mark
slippin’ out when he thinks you’re asleep? Or coming
home any old time? Besides, some men talk in their
sleep. That gives you another hold. I’m always hoping
Greg will, as he talks so little when he’s awake. You bet
your life he never gets a room to himself.”</p>

<p>“Poor Mr. Compton!” thought Ora. “I fancy he’ll expiate.”
“Shall we go downstairs?” she asked. “I got
my portfolios out this morning.”</p>

<p>She tactfully had shown Ida her wardrobe first, and
the guest descended to the library in high good humour.
For an hour they hung over the contents of the Italian
portfolios. Ida was enchanted with the castles and ruins,
listened eagerly to the legends, and was proud of her own
knowledge of the horrors enacted in the Coliseum. But
over the photographs of the masterpieces in the Pitti and
the Uffizi she frankly yawned.</p>

<p>“No more cross-eyed saints, and fat babies and shameless
sporting women in mine,” she announced. “Them
virgins sitting on thrones, holding four-year-olds trying to
look like six months, make me tired.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>“Oh, well, I fancy you must see the old masters for
the first time in their proper setting—and wonderful
colouring——” Ora wondered if the masterpieces would
appear somewhat overrated to herself if seen for the first
time in Butte. It certainly was interesting to watch the
effect of fixed standards—or superstitions—upon an untrained
but remarkably sharp mind.</p>

<p>“That Last Supper looks like they’d been eating the
paint,” pursued Ida.</p>

<p>Ora laughed. “I shan’t show you any more pictures today.
This furniture is Italian—Florentine and Venetian.
Let me tell you something about it.”</p>

<p>“I’d like to see all your rooms.” Ida rose and stretched
herself luxuriously. Ora thought she looked like a beautiful
Persian cat. “Houses interest me mor’n pictures,
although I’ll buy them too some day. Not old masters,
though. They’d give me the willys. This carved oak with
faded gilt panels is a dream!” she exclaimed with instant
appreciation. “I’d learn wood-carving if there was anyone
in this God-forsaken camp to teach it.”</p>

<p>Ora clapped her hands, and once more, to Ida’s startled
eyes she looked like a very young girl. “I studied several
of the crafts when I was in Germany,” she cried, “wood-carving,
brass-hammering, enamelling. I’ll set up a workshop—let
me see, the attic would be the best place, and
the furnace warms it—and teach you, and work myself.
It’s just what I need. I wonder I never thought of
it——”</p>

<p>“Need what?” interrupted Ida sharply.</p>

<p>“Oh, a relief from too much study. There’s nothing
like a craft for mental workers—I should have thought
of it before,” she repeated. “What do you say?”</p>

<p>“I’d like it first rate, and I guess you’ll find me quick
enough with my hands, whatever you think of my cocoanut.”</p>

<p>“I think very highly of your cocoanut. This is my little
drawing-room.”</p>

<p>Ida stood on the threshold for a few moments without
comment. She had never cast a thought to her Puritan
inheritance, but anger, disapproval, possessed her. She
hated the room, but had no reason to give.</p>

<p>“You don’t like my favourite room?” asked Ora, who
was watching her curiously.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>“Is it your favourite room?” She turned this over.
“No, I guess I like the heavy, solid, durable things best.”
She struggled for her reasons. “You get your money’s
worth in them. This looks like the first Chinook would
blow it clear over into North Dakota, or as if you might
come in some morning and find a heap of dust where it
had been the night before—like a corpse when the air’s
let in. I didn’t mind your bedroom being dainty and
looking like some sea shells I saw once in a picture frame,—it
looks all of a piece, too, you might say; but this—with
them queer thin faded out chairs and sofas—the colours on
the wood even, and them pictures over the doors and
mantel look like they would do the final disappearing act
while you wait—well, there’s something kinder mysterious—ghostly—it
looks so stiff—and—at the same time—so
kinder immoral——”</p>

<p>“I wonder if what you are groping for is the atmosphere
of the past, which all old furniture must have, particularly
if rearranged in something like its original setting.”
Ora was regarding her with a new interest. “This
furniture came out of a <i>hôtel</i>—what we would call a residence—with
a history—several histories, I should think—and
I fancy it was all frivolous, and wicked, and exciting——”</p>

<p>“I ain’t no spiritualist!” said Ida tartly. “Is that what
you’re driving at?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know that I was thinking of occultism, even,”
said Ora lightly. “But it is interesting to find these old
things have atmosphere for you as well as for me——”</p>

<p>“Why is it your favourite room? Because it has ‘atmosphere’?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know. I doubt if I have ever given the matter
a thought.”</p>

<p>“So this is your favourite room.” Ida turned her back
on it. “H’m. Well, maybe I’ll understand some things
better one of these days than I do now. Perhaps,” with
one of her uncanny dashes of intuition, “I’ll understand it
when I do you.”</p>

<p>“Let us go up to the attic and look it over. I’ll have
the table and benches made tomorrow.” Something was
moving toward expression in her own mind, but she flung it
aside and ran up the stair followed by Ida, who dismissed
the subject as promptly.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">THERE had been a good deal of haggling over the lease
of the Oro Fino Primo mine, the engineers demanding
a three years’ lease and bond, proposing to purchase it
at the end of that period for fifty thousand dollars. Nor
were they willing to pay more than ten per cent. in royalty,
displaying the assay report on the ore and arguing
that after the necessary outlay on development work, the
ore body might be too small to repay them.</p>

<p>Mark, however, was determined not to close with them
until he had visited the claim with Gregory Compton, and
this proved to be impossible for several weeks. The engineers,
unable to proceed, had dismissed their men. They
threatened to withdraw their offer and look for another
abandoned property. Mark told them to go ahead, and
they remained in Butte.</p>

<p>In the course of a month Mark and Gregory were both
free on a Sunday. They took a train for Pony, hired a
rig and drove over to the Stratton claim, dignified by the
name of mine.</p>

<p>The claim was on a small tableland between Gregory’s
own hill, which terminated just beyond the borders of his
ranch, and another slope covered with pines and firs.
The engineers had put up a windlass, retimbered the
shaft, sunk it twenty feet lower, and added a pile of dirty
looking ore to the original half-obliterated heap about the
collar of the shaft.</p>

<p>Gregory picked up half a dozen pieces of various sizes
and examined them. “Their assay was about right, I should
think,” he said. “Looks like good low grade ore, but
not too good. It will do no harm to assay it myself, however,”
and he dropped the sample into the pocket of his
coat. Suddenly he gave a startled exclamation, and Mark
saw his nostrils dilate, his nose almost point, as he darted
forward and kicked aside a heap of loosely piled quartz.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>
Then he knelt down and lifted out several lumps of greyish-black
ore.</p>

<p>“What is it?” asked Mark curiously, and feeling
something of the excitement of the hunter whose gun is
trained on a bear. “D’you mean they’ve found copper
glance?”</p>

<p>“At a depth of sixty feet? Not exactly. This is a basic
igneous rock called pyroxenite, that may not be rich in
gold but is more than likely to be—particularly as our
friends have hidden it so carefully and said nothing about
it. It may assay anywhere from ten dollars a ton to five
hundred. I’m going down.”</p>

<p>The shaft was inclined, four by eight, and timbered
with lagging. Gregory lit the candle he had brought and
descended the ladder. He remained below about ten minutes;
when he returned to the surface he was excited and
triumphant.</p>

<p>“They’ve begun to drift on the vein,” he announced.
“They’ve gone about three feet—it must have been then
they learned the history of the claim. It’s pyroxenite all
right, every inch of it.”</p>

<p>“Well, damn them!” said Mark.</p>

<p>“They can’t plead that they didn’t recognise the ore,
uncommon as it is, because they began to drift the moment
they struck the vein. It dips toward the ranch,” he
added abruptly.</p>

<p>Mark whistled. “It’s pretty close. That would be a
kettle of fish—if it apexed on your land! Lawsuit.
Friendship of a lifetime broken. The beautiful Mrs. Mark
Blake brings suit against the now famous Gregory Compton——”</p>

<p>“Oh, nonsense!” said Gregory shortly. But he was
disturbed nevertheless.</p>

<p>“But there’s no nonsense in the idea that your own
ore bodies may be just over the border. Why don’t you
sink a shaft, just for nuts.”</p>

<p>Gregory, who was still excited, felt an impulse to confide
his discovery to his friend. But his natural secretiveness
overcame him and he turned abruptly away. “When
I have finished at the School,” he said, “no doubt I’ll begin
gophering again, but not before. What are you going
to do about this? Let them have it?”</p>

<p>“I’ll let them have a piece of my mind first. What do<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>
you advise?—that I work the mine, myself? I could easily
form a company if the ore is as rich as you think.”</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t take the chances. Lease the claim to them
for a year. They’ll take it for that time with all this ore
in sight. If they’ve hit a large chamber they’ll soon be
netting several thousand dollars a day. If it’s only a
pocket, let them find it out. At the end of a year you’ll
know a good deal more about the mine than you do now.
But keep an eye on them so that they don’t gouge, and
make them pay you twenty per cent. royalty.”</p>

<p>“They’ll pay it through the nose,” said Mark emphatically.</p>

<p>Gregory laughed. “You feel as virtuously indignant
as if you had never tried to do anybody yourself. It’s
do or be done out West as well as back East, and precious
few mines have a clean history. Marcus Daly never would
have got the best part of Butte Hill if he hadn’t kept his
mouth shut.”</p>

<p>“It isn’t that I’m so virtuous,” said Mark ingenuously,
“but I don’t like the idea that anybody so nearly got the
best of me. And just look at the way they covered it up.”</p>

<p>Gregory had kicked aside the greater part of a pile
of grey ore, and revealed quite a hillock of the pyroxenite.
He put several pieces in his pocket, discarding the first
specimens. “I’ll get to work on this tonight,” he said,
“and let you know first thing in the morning. But I’m
willing to wager that it runs from sixty to a hundred dollars
a ton.”</p>

<p>“And not a fleck of gold to be seen!” Mark, who, like
all intelligent men of mining localities, had some knowledge
of ores, examined the dark rock attentively. “They’re
some geologists,” he added with unwilling admiration.
“This would fool any ordinary mining engineer. Say!”
he cried, “I’ll not tell Ora until she’s ready to leave—she’s
figuring on going to Europe in the fall. It will be the
surprise of her life, for I led her to think she’d get only
a hundred or so a month. Don’t say a word about it to
Ida.”</p>

<p>Gregory turned away to hide a curl of his lip. “I suppose
we’d better go over and see Oakley, as we’re so close,”
he said. “He’ll probably talk for an hour on his hobby,
but any knowledge comes in useful to a lawyer.”</p>

<p>“What’s he done.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span>“He figured out that Iowa and the Dakotas and Kansas
were likely to have a drought next year, so he will sow
about five hundred acres with flax in May. He has already
put in about three hundred acres of winter wheat. The
bottoms are reserved for alfalfa. He raises the capital
and gets half profits. If it turns out as he expects he’ll
have something at the end of a year to live on besides enthusiasm
for intensive farming.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>They were driving toward Pony two hours later when
Gregory said abruptly, “I’m glad that your wife and mine
have taken to each other. It is a great thing for Ida. The
improvement is wonderful.” He forebore to add, even to
the man who had known his wife since childhood, “I don’t
see what Mrs. Blake gets out it,” but possibly the irrepressible
thought flew into Mark’s mind, for he replied
promptly:</p>

<p>“It’s great for Ora. She’s tired of everybody else here;
tired of so much reading too. I’ve seen that for some time,
though I haven’t let on. A new interest was just what
she wanted. Every clever woman has a touch of the school
ma’am in her, and no one can deny that Ida’s refreshing.
To Ora she’s almost a novelty. I think she rather hates to
make her over, but she’s working on her as hard as I
work on a case. Ora’s the thorough sort. What she does
is done with all her might and main. Otherwise she don’t
do it at all. She’s equally accomplished at that!”</p>

<p>He decided that this was the propitious moment; Gregory
was in an uncommonly melting mood, for him. “Say!”
he continued, “Ora and I have put up a little job on you.
I’ve told her to take her new money and go to Europe for
six months or so—By James, she shall go, even if this
thing hangs fire and I have to sell some stock. It’s over
six years since she’s seen Europe, and I guess she pines
for it all right. Well, she wants to take Ida.”</p>

<p>Gregory demanded with unexpected promptness, “How
much would it cost?”</p>

<p>“Oh, about a hundred to New York and a hundred and
fifty over,” said Mark vaguely. “Of course when two are
together it costs less. And in Europe distances are short.
Ora says she shall go to <i>pensions</i> instead of hotels, if only
because they would be two young women alone; and they
cost much less. They can also travel second-class, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>
third in Germany and Switzerland. Ora says she and her
friends always did it in summer because it was cooler and
more interesting. She’s sent for a lot of Baedekers, is
going to make a close estimate, then double it.”</p>

<p>“One of my aunts died the other day and left me a
thousand dollars; she had no family. Ida can have it. Of
course I could send her more if she needed it, but she’s
clever with money.”</p>

<p>“That will do it.” (He knew that if it did not Ora,
who would pay the bills, would manage to hoodwink Ida.)
“And you must live with me. It’ll be fine. Bachelor’s
Hall. We’ll do as we damn please.”</p>

<p>Gregory shook hands with him, his strong hard face
illuminated with the infrequent smile that gave it something
of a sweet woman’s charm. “Thanks, old man,” he
said fervently. “Sounds good!”</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span>

<h3 class="nobreak">XIII</h3>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">SEVERAL weeks passed before Ora sent for Miss Ruby
Miller. She was busier during those weeks than she
had been for many months. Ida came every other day at
one o’clock and remained until five. They carved wood in
the attic, and looked at pictures or read in the library
during the hour and a half that included tea. Ida confessed
that during the latter interval she was so bored
sometimes she could scream, but added that she would
stick it out if she yawned every tooth in her head loose.
One thing that never bored her was the picture of Ora—her
working blouse changed for a dainty house gown—presiding
at the tea-table. She studied every detail, every
gesture; she even cultivated a taste for tea, which heretofore
she had regarded as fit for invalids only, like jellies
and cup-custard.</p>

<p>Ora’s alternate days and many of her evenings were
filled with social duties. Butte was indulging in one of
its hurricanes of festivity. Mrs. O’Hagan, who lived in
the largest and finest house on the West Side, gave a
series of dinner dances. Mrs. Burke, who owned the big
ugly red house of appalling architecture built by Judge
Stratton in the eighties, gave several entertainments in
honour of two young visitors from Denver. Mrs. Maginnis,
who lived in another palatial residence far west and
far from the old Stratton house—which in its day had expressed
the extreme limit of the city, as of fashion—gave a
ball as brilliant as anything Ora had seen in a distant
hemisphere. Flowers may be scarce in Butte, but flowers
and palms may be imported by the carload from Helena,
and the large rooms looked like an oasis in the grey desert
of Butte. Every woman wore a ball gown made by some
one of the great reiterative masters, and there were no
wall flowers; for, although the tango had not yet set the
whole world dancing, the women of Montana never had interpreted
grey hairs as a signal to retire.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>It was on the day after this ball that Ora had telephoned
to Miss Miller. “Can you give me an hour or two tomorrow?”
she asked.</p>

<p>“Sure. Can I come early? I’ve got fourteen heads to
dress for the Cameron ball, and most of them want a
facial too?”</p>

<p>“A what?”</p>

<p>“Face massage, and touchin’ up generally.”</p>

<p>“Oh.”</p>

<p>“It’s fine. Makes you feel as good as you look. What
did you want me to do?”</p>

<p>“Ob, shampoo my hair. I want to consult you about it,
too—and manicure.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’ll bring the creams along, and if you want a
massage I’ll be ready.”</p>

<p>Ora had succeeded in making Miss Miller propose what
she had quite made up her mind to try, and she rang off
with a smile. The evening before she had thought herself
the plainest woman at the party, and the effect of this
discouraging conclusion had been to kill her animation
and sag her shoulders until she knew she must look as
dowdy as she felt. For the first time she realised how a
blighted vanity may demoralise the proudest intellect. It
was time to get a move on, as her new but rapidly developing
friend would put it.</p>

<p>Ora was very proud of her work. She gave Professor
Whalen due credit, and knew that Ida toiled at her exercises,
but doubted if the uninspiring pedant would have
been retained had it not been for the sense of emulation,
slightly tinctured by jealousy, she managed to rouse in her
new boon companion when they were together. But Ida
was now exercising something of her latent force of character,
determined to make the most of advantages for which
she knew many a sudden-rich woman would “give her eye
teeth.” She would polish up “good and plenty” before
her husband made his strike; and waste no precious time
on the inside of her skull when she had the cash to spend
on its outside.</p>

<p>After the first week she dropped no more g’s, her grammar
rapidly improved, and although she never would be
a stylist, nor altogether forswear slang, not only because
the ready-made phrase appealed to her unliterary mind,
but because its use was ingrained, she reserved it more and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span>
more for those that best could appreciate it. As it annoyed
Professor Whalen excessively, she went afield for
new phrases “for the fun of seeing him wriggle.”</p>

<p>On the other hand, whenever she felt in the mood, she
gazed at him with penitent languid eyes, promised never
to use slang again, and amused herself racking other
nerves. She knew just how far to go and “turned him
off,” or “switched him back on to the track” before any
real harm was done. Some day she might let him make
a scene just for the fun of the thing, but not until she
was “good and ready.”</p>

<p>Her feeling for Ora was more difficult to define. Sometimes
she almost loved her, not only inspired by gratitude,
but because Ora’s personal magnetism was intensified by
every charm of refinement, vivacity, mental development,
as well as by a broad outlook on life and a sweetness of
manner which never infuriated her by becoming consciously
gracious. At other times she hated her, for she
knew that no such combination ever could be hers. Ora
was a patrician born of patricians. She might go to the
devil, preside over one of the resorts down on The Flat,
take to drink and every evil way, and still would she be
patrician. Herself might step into millions and carry her
unsullied virtue to her grave and she never would be the
“real thing.” For the first time she understood that being
“a lady” had little to do with morals or behaviour. Nothing
irritates the complacent American more than the sudden
appreciation of this fact.</p>

<p>“But I guess I’ll be as good as some others,” Ida consoled
herself. “After all, I don’t see so many Ora Blakes
lying round loose. People don’t bother much these days
if your clothes make their mouth water and your grammar
don’t queer you.”</p>

<p>Gregory, when he had time to think about it—he read
even at the breakfast and dinner-table, and had an assay
plant in the cellar—was charmed with her improvement,
and told her abruptly one day that if she kept faithfully
to her tasks until November he would give her the thousand
dollars he had received under the will of his aunt.
“And you can do what you like with it,” he added. “I
shan’t ask you. That’s the way I enjoyed money when I
was a kid, and I guess women are much the same.”</p>

<p>“A thousand dollars!” Ida was rigid, her mouth open.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>
“Geewhil—I beg pardon—My! But you are good!” She
paused to rearrange her thoughts, which were in danger
of flying off into language her husband was paying to
remodel. “Can I really do anything with it I like?”</p>

<p>“You can.” He smiled at her bright wide-open eyes
and flaming cheeks.</p>

<p>“I ain’t—haven’t said anything about it as I didn’t
think it would be any sort of use, but Ora is going to
Europe in the fall, and she told me Mark was going to
try to persuade you to let me go with her. Now I can go
on my thousand dollars, if you don’t mind. Mark wants
you to stay with him.”</p>

<p>“He spoke to me about it—I had forgotten. There
couldn’t be a better arrangement. This is the time for you
to go to Europe—while your mind is still plastic.”</p>

<p>“You don’t seem to mind my going a little bit.” Rapture
gave place to suspicion. Ida was not born with faith
in man.</p>

<p>“My dear child! What good am I to you now? You
might be keeping house for a deaf mute. All I need is the
right kind of food and a comfortable bed. I’ll get both at
Mark’s. Next year you would see even less of me than
you do now. We get our last and most practical drilling
in ore-dressing, metallurgy, power-utilisation, and geology.
We shall be off half the time on geological expeditions,
visits to mines in other parts of the state, smelters, the
most up-to-date of the cyanide mills. So you see how
much I shall be at home. Go to Europe and enjoy yourself.”</p>

<p>“All right. I’ll go. You bet. And I’ll not miss a trick.
There’ll never be a thousand dollars better spent.”</p>

<p class="drop-cap">“NOW I’ve got you where I want you, and I’m goin’ to
talk—goin’ to say something I’ve been dyin’ to say
for two or three years.”</p>

<p>Ora’s head was in the wash-basin. Miss Miller was
leisurely spraying out the lime juice with which she had
drenched her hair. Ora gasped, then gurgled something
unintelligible, which Miss Ruby interpreted as encouragement
to proceed. Mrs. Blake’s manner ever since the hairdresser’s
arrival had been uncommonly winning, with something
half-appealing, half-confiding that flew straight not
only to that experienced young woman’s sympathies but to
her professional instinct.</p>

<p>“It’s this,” she continued. “You need a thorough
overhauling. In these days, particularly in this altitude,
women take care of themselves as they go along, but you
don’t. You’ve lost your complexion ridin’ and walkin’ for
hours without a veil, sometimes without a hat, and you
with a delicate skin like a baby’s and not even using
creams. I heard a man say only last Sunday—I was
givin’ his wife a facial and he was sittin’ round—that it
was an awful pity you had gone off so, as you were the
prettiest thing he ever laid eyes on when you came back
after your pa’s death, and if Mark—Mr. Blake—hadn’t
snapped you up before any other young man got a look
at you you’d have had a dozen chances, for all you’ve got
such a reputation for brains. ‘A man can stand brains in
a white lily of a girl,’ says he, ‘but when she gets older
she’s either got to keep her complexion or cut out the
brains, and Ora Blake’s done neither’—Say if you squirm
like that you’ll get your mouth and eyes full of lemon.
His wife said she didn’t believe men cared for them thin
white women anyway—she’s bustin’ with health herself—and
he gave a grunt that means a lot to a girl who knows
men like I do. You never did make anything of yourself
and you’ve let yourself go these last two or three years<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>
something shameful. If you’d take yourself in hand, get
on to yourself once for all, you’d have people twistin’ their
necks off to look at you and callin’ you a Mariposa lily, or
a Princess Pine, or a White Gladiolus and other poetry
names like that. And you could get the reputation of a
beauty all right. It makes me sick.”</p>

<p>“Could you make me into a beauty?” Ora’s voice was
remarkably languid considering the flaming hue of her
face, which, however, may have been due to its prolonged
sojourn in the wash-basin. Miss Miller had wrung her
hair out and was rubbing it vigorously.</p>

<p>“Couldn’t I <i>just</i>?”</p>

<p>As Mrs. Blake maintained a dignified silence, Miss Ruby
proceeded to develop her theme. “Now, your hair, for
instance. That’s the reason I used lemon today. You’ve
been usin’ soap, and, what with this dry climate, and no
care, it’s as harsh and broken as if you’d been usin’ soda
on it every day. It’s lemon and hot water for you, first,
last and always, and eggs after a journey. It needs a
couple of months of hand-massage every other day right
now; after that it will be up to you. Brush it night and
morning and use a tonic twice a year.”</p>

<p>She paused and Ora waited with eyes closed to conceal
her impatience. Finally she opened them irresistibly and
met Miss Ruby’s in the mirror. They, too, looked embarrassed.
Ora’s smile was spontaneous and sweet and not
too frequent. It seldom failed to melt reserve and inspire
confidence. She played this card without delay.</p>

<p>“Why don’t you go on?” she asked. “All that is most
interesting and valuable. I shall remember every word
of it.”</p>

<p>“Well—I was afraid that what I want to say most might
sound as if I was drummin’ up trade, and the Lord knows
I’ve got more to do than I could manage if there was ten
days in every week. I turned down two ladies today to
come here. I never shampoo the day of a ball.”</p>

<p>“My dear Miss Miller! You are an artist, and like all
artists, you not only aim at perfection yourself but your
eyes and fingers ache at imperfection. I suppose an author
rewrites sentences as he reads them, and painters must
long to repaint every picture they see. As for you—we
are your page and canvas, and naturally we have the good
fortune to interest you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span>“That’s it!” cried Miss Ruby, glowing. “That’s the
size of it, only I couldn’t ever say it like that. Well, now,
if you want this skin to look like a complexion and not like
a hide, I’ve got to give you a massage every third day for
quite a while. It not only needs creams and cold applications—hot
only once in a while—but an awful lot of hand
massage. It’s all run down and needs stimulating the worst
way. Another year and you’d be havin’ lines. You can’t
leave yourself to nature up here. She’s in too great a
hurry to take back what she gave. And you must cut out
hot breads and trash and wear a veil when you go out in
the sun and wind. And you go to Boulder Springs once a
week and take a vapour bath.”</p>

<p>“But I’ll always look washed-out.”</p>

<p>“Not if you look fresh, and wear colours that suit you.”</p>

<p>“And I never was called a beauty. That man, whoever
he was, merely remembered the usual prettiness of youth.
Every young girl is pretty unless she is ugly.”</p>

<p>“Well, I guess you didn’t take enough pains to make
people think you were a beauty. Some—Ida Compton, for
instance—don’t need to do anything but just show themselves.
Any fool—particularly a man—can see black hair
and red and white skin, and meltin’ eyes, and lashes a
yard long, and a dashin’ figure. But odd and refined
types like you—well, you’ve got to help it out.”</p>

<p>“How very interesting! Do you mean I must go about
telling people that I am really beautiful, if they will only
look at me long enough? Or—possibly—do you mean that
I should make up?”</p>

<p>“I don’t mean either, ’though in a way I mean both.
In the first place you’ve got to make the most of your
points. You’re not a red blonde or a gold blonde, but what
the French call sendray; in plain English, you’ve got ash-coloured
hair. Now, that makes the blondest kind of
blonde, but at the same time it’s not so common, and
nature has to give it to you. Art can’t. What you want
to do is to let people see that your colouring is so rare
that you can’t get enough of it yourself, and by and by
people will think they can’t either. You’ve been wearin’
all this hair twisted into a hard knot down on your neck.
That don’t show off the hair and don’t suit your face,
which is kinder square. I’m goin’ to pull it soft about
your face and ears and then coil it softly on top of your<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>
head. That’ll give length to your face, and look as if you
was proud of your hair—which you will be in a month or
two. You mustn’t pay too much attention to the style of
the moment. You’re the sort to have a style of your own
and stick to it.”</p>

<p>“I’m in your hands,” murmured Ora. “What next?”</p>

<p>“Did you really lose interest in yourself?” asked Miss
Miller curiously, and with the fine freedom of the West
from class restraint. “Or didn’t you ever have any?”</p>

<p>“A little of both. When I was a girl I was a frightful
pedant—and—Oh, well—Butte is not Europe, and I took
refuge more than ever in books, particularly as I could
have nothing of the other arts. You know the resources of
Butte!”</p>

<p>“I’m glad you’re goin’ to Europe again, where I guess
all kinds of variety are on tap.—Say, perhaps you’ll find
out all the new kinks for the complexion in Paris, and tell
me when you come back.”</p>

<p>“I will indeed!”</p>

<p>“I don’t hold to rippin’ the skin off, or hoistin’ it up,”
said Miss Miller firmly. “All any skin needs is steady treatment,
and constant care—constant, mind you, and never
forget it. Now there’s your profile. It’s grand. The way
I’m goin’ to fix your hair’ll show it off, and don’t you let
it get scooped round the eyes, like so many women do.
Massage’ll prevent that. I wish your eyebrows and lashes
was black, like so many heroines in novels has. The contrast
would be fine. But brown’ll do, and I guess the natural
is your lay. Luckily them black grey eyes is a high
note, and when you get your lips real red, you’ll have all
the colour your style can carry. The gleamin’ white skin’ll
do the rest.”</p>

<p>“How am I to get red lips, and what’s to make my skin
gleam?”</p>

<p>“You’re anæmic. You go to a doctor and get a tonic
right off. When I get through with your complexion it’ll
gleam all right. No powder for you. It improves most
women, but you want high lights. I don’t mean shine
when I say gleam, either. I mean that you’ve got the
kind of skin that when the tan’s off and it’s toned up and
is in perfect condition (you’ve got to be that inside, too),
sheds a sort of white light. It’s the rarest kind, and I
guess it does the most damage.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span>“And what good is all this beautifying to do me? And
why make me dangerous? Surely you are not counselling
that I begin a predatory raid on other women’s husbands,
or even on the ‘brownies’?”</p>

<p>“Well, I guess not. I don’t approve of married women
lettin’ men make love to them, but I do believe in a woman
makin’ the most of herself and gettin’ all the admiration
that’s comin’ to her. If you can be a beauty, for the Lord
Almighty’s sake be one. Believe me, it’ll make life seem
as if it had a lot more to it.”</p>

<p>“I shouldn’t wonder!”</p>

<p>“And you go in right off for deep breathin’ and Swedish
exercises night and mornin’. It’s the style to be thin, but
you want to develop yourself more. And they keep you
limber—don’t forget that. When a woman stiffens up
she’s done for. Might as well get fat round her waist.
Now shut your eyes, I’m goin’ to massage.”</p>

<p class="drop-cap">“I &#160;WONDER!” thought Ora, “I wonder!”</p>

<p>It was some four months after her first séance with
Miss Ruby Miller. There was no question of the improvement
in her looks, owing, perhaps, as much to a new self-confidence
as to the becoming arrangement of her hair
and the improved tint and texture of her skin. The tonic
and a less reckless diet had also done their work; her eyes
were even brighter, her lips pink. Moreover, it was patent
that the sudden reformation was as obvious to Butte as to
herself. Women confessed to a previous fear that the
“altitude had got on her nerves or something”; as for
the men, they may or may not have observed the more
direct results of Miss Miller’s manipulations, but it was
not open to doubt that her new interest in herself had
revived her magnetism and possibly doubled it.</p>

<p>Ora turned from the mirror in her bedroom, where she
had been regarding her convalescing beauty with a puzzled
frown, and stared down at the rough red dirt of her half-finished
street—she lived far to the west. Her eyes travelled
up to the rough elevation upon which stood the
School of Mines in its lonely splendour, then down to the
rough and dreary Flat. It stretched far to the south, a
hideous expanse, with its dusty cemetery, its uninviting
but not neglected road houses, its wide section given over
to humble dwellings, with here and there a house of more
pretensions, but little more beauty. It was in one of these
last, no doubt, that her father had kept his mistress, whose
children, she was vaguely aware, attended the public
schools under his name. These houses, large and small,
were crowded together as if pathetically conscious that
the human element must be their all, in that sandy, treeless,
greenless waste.</p>

<p>There was something pathetic, altogether, thought Ora,
in the bright eagerness with which even the wealthy class
made the most of their little all. They were so proud of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span>
Columbia Gardens, a happy-go-lucky jumble of architectures
and a few young trees, a fine conservatory and obese
pansies on green checkers of lawn; they patronised its
Casino so conscientiously on Friday nights when the
weather would permit. During the winter, they skated
on their shingled puddle down on The Flat as merrily
and thankfully as though it were the West End of London
or one of the beautiful lakes in one of the beautiful
German “gartens.” They motored about the hideous environs,
and hung out of the car to emphasise their rapture
at the lonely tree or patch of timid verdure; they entertained
royally in their little Club House, out in another
desolate waste, or played golf without envy or malice. In
short they resolutely made the most of Butte when they
were in it; they patted Butte and themselves on the back
daily; they loved it and they were loyal to it and they got
out of it as often as they possibly could.</p>

<p>“And I!” thought Ora, with a sense of panic. “I, who
will probably get away every five years or so—what am
I waking up for—to what end? I wonder!”</p>

<p>She walked slowly downstairs and, avoiding the little
French drawing-room, went into the library and sat down
among her books. Sash curtains of a pale canary colour
shut out the rough vacant lots and ugly dwellings above
her home, and cast a mellow glow over the brown walls and
rows of calf-bound books. Judge Stratton had read in
four modern languages and two dead ones. The love of
reading, of long evenings alone in his deserted “mansion,”
had been as striking a characteristic of his many-sided
ego as his contempt for moral standards. Ora, who
had grown into a slow but fairly thorough knowledge of
her father’s life and character, permitted her thoughts to
flow freely this afternoon and to speculate upon what her
life might have been had Judge Stratton been as upright
as he was intellectually gifted; if her mother had possessed
the brains or charm to keep him ensnared; if she
herself had been left, an orphan at twenty, with the fortune
she inevitably would have inherited had her father
behaved himself—instead of finding herself penniless,
ignorant of all practical knowledge, a querulous invalid on
her hands, her only suitor the “hustling” son of her
mother’s old seamstress.</p>

<p>Ora admitted no disloyalty to Mark as she put these<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span>
questions for the first time squarely to herself. She intended
to continue to treat him with unswerving friendship,
to give him all the assistance in her power, as long
as she lived. And, as husbands went, she made no doubt
that he was one to thank her grudging providence for.
But that she would have considered him for a moment
had she inherited the fortune her father had made and
dissipated was as likely as that she would have elected to
live her life in Butte.</p>

<p>She knew Mark’s ambitions. Washington was his goal,
and he was by no means averse from being governor of
his state meanwhile. Nor would he have been a genuine
American boy, born in the traditional log cabin—it had
been a log cabin as a matter of fact—if he had not cherished
secret designs on the White House. In all this, did
it prove to be more or less, she could be of incalculable
assistance to him. And she was the more determined to
render this assistance because she had accepted his bounty
and was unable to love him.</p>

<p>She concluded with some cynicism that the account
would be squared, being by no means blind to what she
had done for him already in the way of social position
and prestige; still, it was not only his right, but a penance
demanded by her self-respect. She was living the most
unidealistic life possible to a woman of her pride and
temperament, but she would redeem it as far as lay in her
power.</p>

<p>She moved impatiently, her brows puzzled again, and
something like fear in her heart. What did this slow
awakening portend? Why had she instinctively held it
back with all her strength, quite successfully until her new-born
vanity, with its infinite suggestions, had quickened
it suddenly into imperious expression?</p>

<p>Certainly she was conscious of no desire for a more
idealistic union with another man. If she had inherited
a fortune, she would have married no one; not then, at all
events; nothing had been further from her desire. She
would have lived in Europe and travelled in many lands.
Beyond a doubt her hunger for the knowledge that lies in
books would have been satiated long since, never would
have assumed a discrepant importance. She would be uniformly
developed, and she would have met many men.
With the double passport of birth and wealth, added to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span>
the fine manner she owed to her Southern mother, her
natural vivacity and magnetism, and a physical endowment
that she now knew could have been trained into
positive beauty, she would have had her pick of men. And
when a woman may choose of the best, with ample time at
her disposal, it was incredible that the true mate, the
essential companion, should not be found before it was too
late. Most marriages are makeshifts; but for the fortunate
few, with the intelligence to wait, and the developed instinct
to respond, there was always the possibility of the
perfect union.</p>

<p>Ora made a wry face at this last collocation. She had
no yearning for the “perfect union.” Matrimony had
been too unutterably distasteful. She turned hastily from
the subject and recalled her father’s impassioned desire
that she should make the West her home, her career, marry
a Western man, give him and her state the benefit of her
endowments and accomplishments. Possibly, surfeited with
Europe, she would have returned to Montana to identify
herself with its progress, whether she married or not. She
was artistic by temperament and training, and correspondingly
fastidious; she cordially detested all careers pursued
by women outside those that were the natural evolution
of an artistic gift. But she could have built herself an
immense and splendid house, filled it with the most exquisite
treasures American money could coax from the
needy aristocracy of Europe, and have a famous salon;
invite the pick of the artistic, literary, musical, and political
world to visit her for weeks or months at a time, house
parties of a hundred or more, and so make her state
famous for something besides metals, intensive farming,
and political corruption. No one could deny that the state
would benefit exceedingly.</p>

<p>Conceivably, in time she would take a husband, assuredly
one of high ambitions and abilities, one whose
fortunes probably would take him to Washington.</p>

<p>This brought her back to Mark, and she laughed aloud.
She had been romancing wildly; of late she had grudgingly
admitted that nature may have composed her to be romantic
after she had recovered from the intellectual obsession;
and the circle had brought her round to her
husband! He was “forging ahead” with extraordinary
rapidity. She made no doubt that he would be a millionaire<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>
within the ten years’ limit he had set himself. Nor
would he rely alone upon his legal equipment and the many
opportunities to exercise it when a man was “on the job
all the time”; he watched the development of Montana’s
every industry, new and established. He “bought in on
the ground floor,” gambled discreetly in copper, owned
shares in several new and promising mines, and property
on the most picturesquely situated of the new lakes constructed
for power supply. He invested what he could
afford, and with the precision of the man on the spot.
Yes, he would be one of the Western millionaires, even if
not one of the inordinate ones, and before his ten years had
passed, if no untoward event occurred.</p>

<p>And it was on the cards that she would have her own
fortune before long. She knew that Mark (who had her
power of attorney) had made better terms with the engineers
than he had anticipated, and he dropped mysterious
hints which, knowing his level head, made her indulge in
ornate dreams now and again. But he only smiled teasingly
when she demanded a full explanation, and told her
that she would realise how good or how bad her mine was
when she went to the bank to sign her letter of credit.</p>

<p>For one thing she felt suddenly grateful. She knew
that the mine had been leased for a year only and without
bond. If, during that time it “panned out,” she would
stipulate to mine it herself when the contract expired.</p>

<p>She sat up very straight and smiled. That was what
she would have liked! If her father had but willed her
this mine and capital enough to work it alone! Her fingers
fluttered as they always did when handling ore; she had
wondered before if the prospector’s fever were in her
blood. How she should have enjoyed watching the rock
come up in the buckets as the shaft sank foot by foot, until
they struck the vein; always expecting chambers of incredible
richness, gold, copper, silver. She would even
learn to do the pleasant part of her own assaying; and
she suddenly experienced an intense secretive jealous love
for this mine that was hers and in which might be hidden
shining blocks of those mysterious primary deposits deep
in the sulphide zone; forced up through the veins of earth,
but born how or where man could only guess. It was a
mystery that she wanted to feel close to and alone with,
far in the winding depths of her mine.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span>She got up and moved about impatiently. Her propensity
to dream extravagantly was beginning to alarm her,
and she wished uneasily that she could discover the gift to
write and work it off. Where would it lead her? But she
would not admit for a moment that her released imagination,
pulsing with vitality, and working on whatever she
fed it, only awaited the inevitable moment when it could
concentrate on the one object for which the imagination of
woman was created.</p>

<p>The pendulum swung back and more evenly. She told
herself it was both possible and probable that she had a
good property, however short it might fall of Butte Hill.
She renewed her determination to mine it herself, and
work, work, work. Therein lay safety. The future seemed
suddenly full of alarms.</p>

<p>And there was Mark, his career, his demands, dictated
not so insistently by him as by herself.</p>

<p>Ora’s soul rose in a sudden and desperate revolt beside
which her rising aversion from unmitigated intellect was
a mere megrim. She felt herself to be her father’s daughter
in all her newly-opened aching brain-cells. He had
lived his life to please himself, and if his temptations and
weaknesses might never be hers—how could she tell?—his
intense vitality survived in her veins, his imperious spirit,
his scornful independence. She glanced at the rows of
calf-bound books he had handled so often. Something of
his sinister powerful personality seemed to steal forth and
encompass her, sweep through the quickened corridors of
her brain. Mark Blake was not the man he would have
chosen for his daughter. Western, Mark might be to the
core, but he was second-rate, and second-rate he would
remain no matter what his successes.</p>

<p>And, she wondered, what would this proud ambitious
parent, whose deepest feeling had been for his one legitimate
child, say to her plan to play second fiddle for life
to a man of the Mark Blake calibre? He had wanted her
to marry in the West, but he had been equally insistent
that she should develop a personality and position of her
own. No devoted suffragist could have been a more ardent
advocate of woman’s personal development than
Judge Stratton had been where his daughter was concerned.
To the rights of other women he had never cast a
thought.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span>This was the hour of grim self-avowal. She admitted
what had long moved in the back of her mind, striving
toward expression, that she hated herself for having married
any man for the miserable reason that has driven so
many lazy inefficient women into loveless marriages. She
should have gone to work. More than one of her father’s
old friends would have given her a secretaryship. She
could have lived on her little capital and taken the four
years’ course at the School of Mines, equipping herself
for a congenial career. If that had not occurred to her
she could have taught French, Italian, German, dancing,
literature. In a new state like Montana, with many women
raised abruptly from the nethermost to the highest stratum,
there was always a longing, generally unfulfilled, for the
quick veneer; and women of older fortunes welcomed opportunities
to improve themselves. She could have taken
parties to Europe.</p>

<p>She had played the coward’s part and not only done
a black injustice to herself but to Mark Blake. He was
naturally an affectionate creature, and, married to a comfortable
sweet little wife, he would have been domestic and
quite happy. In spite of his enjoyment of his club, his
cards and billiards, and his buoyant nature, she suspected
that he was wistful at heart. He was intensely proud of
his wife, in certain ways dependent upon her, but she
knew he had taken for granted that her girlish coldness
would melt in time and womanly fires kindle. Well, they
never would for him, poor Mark. And possessing an inherent
sense of justice, she felt just then more sympathy
for him than for herself, and placed all his good points to
his credit.</p>

<p>She was conscious of no sympathy for herself, only of
that deep sense of puzzlement, disturbance, apprehension.
Revolt passed. Indications—the abrupt bursting into
flower of many unsuspected bulbs in her inner garden:
softness, sympathy, a more spontaneous interest in and
response to others, the tendency to dream, vague formless
aspirations—had hinted, even before she took her new-born
vanity to Miss Ruby Miller, that she was on the
threshold of one of the dangerous ages (there are some
ten or fifteen of them), and that unless she had the doubtful
wisdom and resolution to burn out her garden as the
poisonous fumes of roasting ores had blasted the fruitful<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span>
soil of Butte, she must prepare to face Life, possibly its
terrible joys and sorrows.</p>

<p>She sprang to her feet and ran upstairs and dressed
for the street. At least she had one abiding interest and
responsibility, Ida Compton. She was a self-imposed and
absorbing duty, and always diverting.</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap">“OH, you give me the willys!”</p>

<p>“My dear Mrs. Compton! How often have you
promised me——”</p>

<p>“Well, if you will stare at me like a moonstruck setter
dog when I’m trying to think up ’steen synonyms for
one old word without looking in the dictionary! I can’t
blow up my vocabulary like a paper bag and flirt with
you at the same time.”</p>

<p>“I have no desire to flirt with you!” said Professor
Whalen with great dignity. “It is quite the reverse. You
have been playing with my feelings for months.”</p>

<p>“Don’t flatter yourself. I’ve been too set on becoming
a real lady before leaving for Europe—haven’t thought
about you.”</p>

<p>Professor Whalen turned a deep dull red. His overlapping
upper teeth shot forward as if to snap down upon
his long rather weak chin. He stared past Ida through
the open window. It was May and the snow was melting
on the mountains, had disappeared from the streets of
Butte; there is a brief springtime in Montana between the
snows of winter and the cold rains of June, and today
was soft and caressing.</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you what is the matter with you,” said Ida,
cruelly. “It’s the spring of the year.”</p>

<p>Whalen sprang to his feet. For the first time in his
anæmic life he was furiously angry, and he rejoiced in
the sensation. “I wish you were a man,” he stuttered.
“I’d beat you. It would do my heart good.”</p>

<p>“If you were a real man you would enjoy beating a
woman a long sight more,” goaded Ida, who watched him
as a man-eating tigress may watch the squirming victim
between her paws. She had fed her vanity and amused
herself by playing on the little man’s pale emotions until
she was convinced he really was in love with her. She<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span>
suddenly made up her mind to force him to “let go,” and
experience the sensation of being made love to feloniously.</p>

<p>“I am not a brute,” announced Whalen, still in the
same stifled voice. His face was purple, but he was conscious
of a warning whisper that he was in a fair way to
lose this remunerative pupil. He dismissed the warning.
There is probably no man so insignificant, in whom passion
for the imperative woman does not develop abnormally
the purely masculine conceit. He may despair in solitude,
when devitalised by reaction and doubt, but when in her
presence, under her inviting eye, and hurried to a crisis
by hammering pulses and scorching blood, he is merely
the primitive male with whom to desire is to have.</p>

<p>Ida laughed, a low throaty husky laugh. “If you
were,” she said cuttingly, “you might stand a show.”</p>

<p>“It is you that are brutal,” hissed poor Whalen.</p>

<p>Ida leaned back in her chair and looked at him out of
half-closed eyes. “What induced you to fall in love with
me, anyhow?” she demanded in her sweet lazy voice.
Whalen clenched his hands.</p>

<p>“I am a man if I am not a brute. You are the most
fascinating woman on earth, and you have deliberately
tried to entice me from the path of rectitude I have trod
all my life——”</p>

<p>“What’s that?” Ida sat up straight, her brows drawn
in an ominous frown.</p>

<p>“I have resisted you until today, but I yield——”</p>

<p>“What the devil are you talking about?”</p>

<p>“I expected to be tormented to the utmost limit. But I
have stood all of it that I purpose to stand.” His voice
by this time was a subdued roar. “I don’t care whether
you love me or not. I don’t think you could love anybody.
I have read that sirens never do. But you are an enchantress,
and you have shown plainly enough——”</p>

<p>Ida’s frown had relaxed, but her eyes blazed. He misunderstood
their expression, as well as the sudden forward
thrust of her head. He sprang forward, caught her by
the shoulders and kissed her.</p>

<p>“Aw!” Ida’s voice was almost a roar. She leaped
to her feet, twirled him about, caught him by the back of
his collar and the seat of his trousers, and threw him out
of the window as if he had been an offensive dog. She
flung his hat and stick after him and slammed the window<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span>
down. Then she stamped her feet in inarticulate rage,
and rubbed and bit her mouth. It was one thing to play
with a man’s passions and quite another to be defiled by
them. Ida seethed with the fierce virtue of a young inexperienced
and temperamentally cold woman. For a few
moments she used very bad language indeed, and struggled
with an impulse to ran after the “little puppy” and whip
him in the street. But, remembering that she was making
a heroic attempt to be a grande dame, she finally went into
her bedroom and washed her face.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">THERE was a knock on the front door. Ida, smoothing
her hair, hastened to open it, glad of diversion.
Ora stood there. For a moment the girls looked hard at
each other, then burst into laughter.</p>

<p>“What’s up?” asked Ida. “You look——”</p>

<p>“My dear, it is I who should ask? Your face is crimson;
you look as if you had just given someone a beating,
and I met poor little Whalen, dusty, dishevelled, growling
like a mad dog—he didn’t know me.”</p>

<p>“Well, I guess he won’t know himself for a while,”
said Ida drily, leading the way into the parlour. “When
he comes to he’ll have his work cut out to climb back to
his little two-cent pedestal and fit on his battered halo.”
She related the incident. “What do you know about
that?” she demanded in conclusion. “Wouldn’t it come
and get you?”</p>

<p>“I am afraid you have made an enemy. It is always
best to let them down gently, save their pride—and—ah!—it
isn’t customary to throw gentlemen out of the window!”</p>

<p>“Gentlemen!” snorted Ida. “He’s no gentleman. He
not only kissed me with his horrid front teeth, but he insinuated
that I was just languishing for him, the——”
Once more Ida’s feelings overflowed in language not intended
for print. “It made me so mad I’d have lammed
him with the umbrella if we’d been in the hall.”</p>

<p>“Ida,” asked Ora abruptly, “would you have minded
so much if he had been good-looking and attractive?”</p>

<p>“Well—perhaps—I guess in that case I’d simply have
smacked him and let him get out quick by the front door.
But I don’t want any man touching me. I’m a married
woman.”</p>

<p>“But if you flirt and lead them on——”</p>

<p>“You said once yourself that American men understood
the game and knew how to take their medicine.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span>“I also said that they can fall more tiresomely in love
than any other men. Of course the Whalens don’t count.
But do you intend to go on making men fall in love with
you and throwing them—metaphorically—out of the window?”</p>

<p>“Much chance I’ll get.”</p>

<p>“You’ll find plenty of chances in Europe. You are a
remarkably beautiful woman. And Europeans take what
we call flirting for shameless encouragement.”</p>

<p>“Well, I guess I’ll be getting experience of the world
all right. And the Lord knows I’d like to be admired by
men who have seen something. I can take care of myself,
and Greg don’t need to worry.”</p>

<p>“I’ve no doubt of that. Of course you are awfully
fond of Mr. Compton, aren’t you?” Ora spoke somewhat
wistfully.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes; fond enough, fonder than a good many wives,
I guess, for he’s kind and pleasant, and no earthly trouble
about the house. But when a woman marries she gets a
kid right there at the altar, and he’s her biggest kid till
his false teeth drop out on his death-bed, and his great-grandchildren
are feeding him through a tube. I don’t
want any of the other sort of kids, and I guess I’m not
what you call the maternal woman, but the Lord knows
I’m a mother to Greg and a good one. I’d like to know
what he’d do without me—that’s the only reason I hate
leaving. He never thinks of changing his shoes when
they’re wet, and half the time wouldn’t eat anything but
his book if I didn’t put the stuff right in front of him.”</p>

<p>“Mark knows him almost as well as you do, and will
look after him. My maid, who is practically my housekeeper,
and an old family servant, will also keep a maternal
eye on him.”</p>

<p>“He keeps himself tidy,” conceded Ida handsomely.
“Wants clean things every day, but never knows where
to find them. He’ll wander out into the kitchen where I’m
cooking breakfast and ask where his socks are, and they
always in the same drawer.”</p>

<p>“I fancy you’ve spoiled him.”</p>

<p>“Not I. I don’t hold with spoiling men. They’re born
spoiled anyhow. I found Greg walking round in a dream
when I married, and a pile of socks as high as the door
knob he’d thrown away because they’d holes in them so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span>
tiny you could hardly see them. I darned every one, you
bet, and he’s wearing them now, though he don’t know it.
He’s like that, as dainty as a cat, and as helpless as a blind
kitten. I am a wife and I know my duty,” concluded Ida
virtuously.</p>

<p>“I certainly shall give Custer minute directions. I can’t
have you worrying.”</p>

<p>“I’ll not worry, once I’m started. Don’t you fret!
But what’s the matter with you, Ora? You look kinder
excited, and kinder—well, harassed. How’s that out of
the new pocket dictionary I’ve set up in my head?”</p>

<p>“I’ll soon have to look to my own vocabulary. Oh—I——”</p>

<p>“Something’s up. Spit it out. It’ll do you good.”</p>

<p>“Dear Ida! If you must use slang, do confine yourself
to that which has passed through the mint of polite society.
There is an abundance to choose from!”</p>

<p>“Don’t you worry; I won’t disgrace you. But I must
let out a tuck occasionally when we’re alone. Greg
wouldn’t let me go to any of the Club dances, and I
scarcely ever see Ruby or Pearl, they’re so busy—to say
nothing of myself!”</p>

<p>“Very well,” said Ora, laughing. “Let me be your
safety valve, by all means.”</p>

<p>“Fire away.”</p>

<p>“Oh—how am I to tell you—I scarcely know, myself——”</p>

<p>“I guess you’re waking up. Ruby, who knows human
nature like a book——”</p>

<p>Ora half rose. “Have you been talking me over with
Miss Miller?” she asked haughtily.</p>

<p>“Not much. Hardly seen her since we met. But you
interest Butte, you know. I guess they talk you over
good and plenty. It was only a few days before you called
that the Miller girls visited with me all day, and they
talked a lot about you. Ruby said that if you’d come to
out of the sleeping beauty stage, you’d make things hum,
and that her fingers just itched to get at your skin and
hair.”</p>

<p>“She said that to me once; and I don’t mind telling you
that I called her in some time ago.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’m not a bat. I’ve seen you looking prettier
every day, and there’s only one way to do it, when you’ve<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span>
let yourself go. I’ve had the benefit of Ruby’s advice for
years, and I don’t propose to let myself go, not for a
minute.”</p>

<p>“Right you are. And do live your life normally from
day to day, developing normally. The awakening process,
when the Nature that made you is no longer content to
be a mere footstool for the mind, is almost as painful as
coming to after drowning. I suddenly have become conscious
of myself, as it were; I am interested in many more
things—personal things—I seem to want far more of life
than I did a few months ago——”</p>

<p>“In other words, you don’t know where you’re at.”</p>

<p>Ora laughed merrily. “My present condition could not
be stated more patly!”</p>

<p>“Ora, I don’t want to pry into your confidence, and
you’re not one to give much of that anyhow, but everybody
in Butte knows that you’re not in love with Mark,
and never were, nice as you treat him—only because you
couldn’t be anything but a lady if you tried. Mrs. O’Neil,
one day when she was having a massage, told Ruby all
about your marriage. She said you were the most bewildered
young thing she ever saw, and that Mark snapped
you up before another young man could get a look at you.
Now, I’ve known Mark all my life—he beaued my sister
who died, for a year or two, and his mother’s cottage was
just up the hill anyhow; and although he’s a good chap
and a born hustler, and bound to get rich, he’s not the
sort of man women fall in love with. You wouldn’t have
fallen in love with him, if he’d been born a millionaire,
and travelled and got Butte out of his system. And if
your father had left you well off, you wouldn’t have looked
at him. There’s men, bad and good—that’s to say, better—that
women fall in love with, and there’s men bad and
good that they don’t, not in a thousand years. Poor old
Mark’s a Don’t all right. You ain’t angry at my saying
all this, but Mark was like my own brother for years?”</p>

<p>“Oh, no, I am not angry. You are far too matter-of-fact.
You might be discussing different grades of ore!”</p>

<p>“Well, that’s about it, and the poor ore can’t help itself,
any more than the slag and gangue can, and Mark’s not
either of those, you bet. He’s good metal, all right, only
he didn’t come out of the Anaconda mine—What have
you turned so red about? My! But you do blush easy!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span>“It’s this—do you despise me—do you think I did
wrong—Oh, I mean I have quite suddenly realised that I
never should have married any man for so contemptible a
reason. I should have gone to work——”</p>

<p>“Work? You?”</p>

<p>“Why not? Many a delicately nurtured woman has
earned her bread.”</p>

<p>“The more fool she if she could get a man to earn it
for her. That’s what they’re for. The Lord knows they
pride themselves on the way they do it, being the stronger
sex, and a lot more words. I guess I’d have married before
Greg turned up if I’d met a man I was sure was going
to make something of himself. You did just right to take
a good husband and take him quick when you found yourself
in a hole.”</p>

<p>“Yes—but——” Her blush deepened. “You see—”
Ora never had had an intimate confidant. It was doubtful
if she ever would have; not, at all events, a woman.
But Ida, as she herself would have expressed it, could always
see through a stone wall when there was a crack
in it.</p>

<p>“Oh, shucks!” she said. “Don’t let that worry you.
If you don’t feel that way first you do last, I guess. Most
of us are bored to death, but women have stood it for a
few thousand years, and I guess they can stand it for
a few thousand more. We all of us have to pay high
for anything we want. That’s about the size of it. Forget
it.”</p>

<p>“Thanks, dear, you console me.” Ora smiled with
closed eyes, but she was thrilled with a sudden inexplicable
longing; like other of her recent sensations, it puzzled and
alarmed her.</p>

<p>“Ora!” exclaimed Ida suddenly. “There’s one thing
that’s just as sure as death and taxes; and knowing men
and knowing life don’t help women one little bit. It’s
this: A woman’s got to have her love affair sooner or
later. If she marries for love she’s pretty safe, for ten
or fifteen years, anyhow. But if she doesn’t, well, she’ll
get it in the neck sooner or later—and it’ll be about the
time she begins to sit up and take notice. She’s a regular
magnet then, too. So watch out.”</p>

<p>Ora opened her eyes. They looked like steel. “I have
never given a thought to love. There is nothing I want<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span>
less. I shall continue to make Mark as good a wife as I
know how to be——”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’m not saying you’ll go off the hooks, like some
I could mention in your own bunch, but if the man comes
along you’ll fall in love all right. Might as well try to
stop a waterfall from jumping over the rocks. I’m not so
dead sure I do know what you’d do. Pride, and high
breeding, and duty would pull one way, but—well, I guess
when you marble women get waked up good and plenty,
what they call roused, you’re the worst kind. A considerable
number of other things would pull from the opposite
direction, and one of them would be the man.”</p>

<p>“Ida!” said Ora, aghast. “How do you know so much?
Your opportunities have been very limited.”</p>

<p>“Oh, have they? Wasn’t I born and brought up in a
mining camp? Butte is some education, believe me. I
ran straight all right, not only because the sporting life
had no charms for me but because I figured on moving
over one of these days to Millionaire Gulch. But it wasn’t
for want of opportunity, and the same opportunities were
handed over by men of your crowd—or fixin’ to be. Besides,
some women are born wise that way, I guess, and
I’m one of ’em. You’ve been living in a sort of self-made
heaven all your life, with only books for inhabitants.
I could put you wise every day in the week.”</p>

<p>“It is true that although I saw a good deal of life while
my mother lived so much in the world, and always have
been deeply interested in the work of the psychological
novelists, particularly the Europeans—I—well, I never
applied it to my—never thought much about it until lately.
I do not seem to know myself the least little bit.”</p>

<p>“I guess it’ll be me—Oh, Lord, I—taking you to Europe,
not you me. I’ll see that you don’t get into mischief, for
I’d hate like the dickens to have you go to pieces over
any man. Not one of them that ever lived since Adam is
worth it. They’re all right to marry, all things being
equal, but to sacrifice your life for, nixie. Any style of
man you are partial to? I’ll keep his sort off with a
broom.”</p>

<p>“I’ve never gone so far as even to think——”</p>

<p>“Every woman has her style in men,” said Ida firmly.
“I heard of a woman once who had three husbands and
each one had a wart on his nose.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[109]</span>“Oh, you are funny! I have heard that a woman falls
in love with a type, not with the man, and, like all epigrams,
that one contains a half-truth. I had two or three
girlish fancies; one was an Austrian officer, another a
French nobleman—and not impecunious—he wasn’t a fortune
hunter. The third was a New Yorker who fell in
love with my cousin and married her. I had a few heart
spasms over him, in particular; possibly because he was
quite out of reach. It is true that they were all more of
or less of a type—tall and thin and dark, with something
very keen and clever and modern in their lean—rather
hard faces.”</p>

<p>“Hi!” cried Ida.</p>

<p>“What is the matter? You look at me as if you had
seen a ghost.”</p>

<p>Ida threw back her head and laughed, showing her sharp
little white teeth, and straining her throat until the firm
flesh looked thin and drawn, over too strong muscles.
“Oh, Lord! I was just thinking what a lot of trouble
I’m in for, playing dragon to my lily-white lady. I guess
about half the men in the world are brunettes, fat or lean.
Say, are you going to the Prom? It’s only a month off.”</p>

<p>“I hadn’t thought about it. Probably. I have been
asked to be a patroness, and Mark is sure to want to go.
Have you decided what to wear?”</p>

<p>“Ma gave me a coral-red silk when I married, and I’m
going to make it over and veil it with black net.”</p>

<p>“Splendid!” cried Ora warmly. “Bring it up to the
house. Mrs. Finley is really an excellent seamstress.
We’ll all take a hand. It will be great fun. And you will
look stunning.”</p>

<p>“What will you wear?”</p>

<p>“I expect some gowns from my New York dressmaker
in a few days. It will depend upon the state of my complexion,
I fancy.”</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap">ORA received another budget of Ida’s philosophy on
the day before the Prom; she had taken her a long
string of pink coral she had found among her old possessions,
and after Ida had wound it in her hair and round
her neck, and finally tried on her gown, and then draped
Ora successively in various scarves, remnants of her own
wedding finery—being almost as interested in the new complexion
as Ora herself—they had suddenly come to the
conclusion that while in Europe they would assume the
mental attitude of girls travelling without a chaperon.
They would see the world from the independent girl’s
point of view, flirt like girls, not like married women
(which at least would save their consciences), force men
to accept the phenomenon. For a time they discussed the
superior advantages of being young widows, but, alluring
and even thrilling as were the possibilities evoked, they
dismissed the alternative on the ground that it might
prove a bore always to be on the defensive; man making
no secret of his attitude toward widows. Besides, they
felt a delicacy about burying their indulgent husbands
even in mental effigy. As counterfeit girls they could
crowd enough excitement into six months to serve them
in memory during long periods of Butte.</p>

<p>“It will be some bluff,” cried Ida. “And believe me,
we’ll have the time of our lives. And no remorse in mine.
I intend to flirt the limit, for I’m just ready to quit being
a mother for a while and see a man’s eyes kindle when he
comes nigh—see him playing about at the end of a string.
I didn’t have near enough of it even when I had half Butte
at my feet—excuse what sounds like conceit but is cold
fact. Now, I’m going to light up every man I take a
fancy to. I don’t care an abandoned prospect hole whether
I hurt ’em or not. All they are good for is to give us a
good time.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span>“Ida!” Ora was aghast as she often had been before
at these naked feminine revelations. “You talk like a
man-eater. I hope to heaven I am not like that down
deep.”</p>

<p>“Oh, maybe you won’t be so bad because you haven’t
got as much vanity. Mine’s insatiable, I guess, and good
old Mother Nature taught me the trick of covering it up
with the don’t-care-a-damn air combined with the come-hither
eye. That does the trick. And they get what hurt’s
going. I don’t. You’ll cultivate men, thinking it’s your
vanity waked up, or mere youth, or because it’s time to
have a fling, but what you really are after is the one and
only man. The Companion. The Sympathetic Soul. The
Mate. All that rot. He don’t exist, kiddo. He’s the
modern immaculate conception, and he’s generally stillborn;
the bungling doctor being the plain unadulterated
male inside of himself. You’ve got to be your own companion,
and if you want happiness you can get it by expecting
just nothing of men. Use them. Throw them on
the ash heap. Pass on to the next. Quit sitting on the
watch tower with your eyes trained on the horizon for
the prince that is born and lives and dies in a woman’s
imagination.”</p>

<p>“I have seen happy—united couples—who had been
married for years.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes; some couples are born to jog along together,
and some wives are born man-tamers, and get a lot of
satisfaction out of it. But you’re much too high-falutin’
for that. You’ll always dream of the impossible—not
only in man but of what he’s got to give—which ain’t
much. And I didn’t need all them—those—psychological
and problem and worldly novels you made me read, translated
from half a dozen languages, either. You take my
advice, Ora, and don’t start off on any fool hunt for an
ideal. Men are just matter-of-fact two-legged animals,
and as selfish as a few thousand years of fool women have
naturally made them. He does well while he’s courting
because he’s naturally good at bluff. But every bit
of romance oozes out of him after he’s eaten his first
breakfast of ham and eggs at home. We can keep up the
bluff forever. Men can’t. Each one of them’s got a kid
twin brother inside that plays marbles till he dies and
makes you feel older every day. No, sir! If I ever had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span>
any delusions, I’ve got over them good and plenty. And
I thank the Lord,” she added piously.</p>

<p>“I think that rather adorable, you know: the eternal
boy. And I fancy it is all that saves men from becoming
horrors; in this country, at least—when you consider the
unending struggle, and strain, and sordid business of
money getting. They use up all their bluff in the battle
of life, poor things. Why shouldn’t they be natural with
us?...”</p>

<p>Ora was recalling this conversation as she sat in her
bedroom on the following evening. Her elemental yet uncannily
sophisticated friend had a way of crashing chords
out of jealously hidden nerves, which no exercise of will
could disconnect from the logical parts of the brain. If it
were true that what her now rampant ego, too long
starved, really demanded was man and romance, she
wished she had let herself run to seed until it was too late
to reclaim her lost beauty and adventure into temptation.
But a glance into the mirror deprived her of any
further desire to join the vast sisterhood of unattractive
females. Moreover, she had faith in the dominance of her
will and common sense, and if her beauty would help her
to the mental contacts she craved with brilliant and interesting
men, far be it from her to execrate it.</p>

<p>She dismissed the mood of self-analysis impatiently and
opened her wardrobe, although half inclined not to attend
the Prom. She was one of the patronesses, but her presence
was not essential. It was pre-eminently the night of
nights for young folks—brownies and squabs—and the
absence of a married woman of twenty-six would pass
unrecorded. Not a man in Butte interested her personally,
nor was she in a frame of mind to be interested by
any of the too specialised products of the West. Nor was
she inordinately fond of dancing; there really was no
object in going to this party save to witness the début and
possible triumph of her protégée.</p>

<p>But she felt something more than indifference toward
this party. It was as if a gong sounded a warning in the
depths of her brain—in her subconsciousness, perhaps,
where instinct, that child of ancestral experience, dwelt.
But even while she hesitated she knew that she should
go, and she took one of her new gowns from a long drawer,
and then began to arrange her hair.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span>It was now some five months since Miss Ruby Miller
had taken her in hand, and if the young woman’s bank
account was heavier her pride as an artist far outweighed
it. Ora’s hair was soft, abundant, the colour of warm
ashes. The skin of her face was as white and transparent,
as “pearly” to use its doctor’s own descriptive word, as
the fine protected surface of her slender throat, her thin
but by no means bony neck. Her lips were pink; they
never would be red; and after one taste of “lip stick,”
Ora had declined to have them improved by art. But they
were a soft country-rose pink and suited her clear whiteness
far better than scarlet. Her eyes, never so clear
and startling as now, lighted up the cold whiteness of her
face and made her pink mouth look childish and somewhat
pathetic. If her lips had been red, her face would have
had the sinister suggestion so many women achieve with
the assistance of art; as it was she looked by no means
harmless as she smiled at herself in the mirror and coiled
her hair softly on the top of her head. After some experimenting
she had decided that she could not improve
upon an arrangement which for the present at least was
all her own.</p>

<p>She rang for Custer to hook her gown. It was a very
soft gown of white satin draped about the bust with lace
and chiffon. It was cut to the waist line in the back and
almost as low in front, for her figure was hardly more
developed than a growing girl’s; and it was unrelieved by
colour. She had already put on the string of pearls her
mother had hidden when the other jewels were sold in
Paris. Altogether it was a costume she would not have
dared to wear even two months ago, when a touch of
colour on the bodice or in her hair was necessary to divert
attention from her spoiled complexion.</p>

<p>Custer had been her mother’s maid for many years
and had returned with her to Butte. After an interval of
employment elsewhere, she had come to Ora as soon as
Mark had built his house. She hooked the gown, pinned
up a stray lock with an invisible hairpin, shook out the
little train, and stood off.</p>

<p>“It reminds me of the way your mother used to look,”
she said, “and you’re even prettier than she was, Miss
Ora—now. But I fancy you’ll be more comfortable in this
gown when you wear it in London. These ladies dress<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span>
smartly enough, but never as low as the English ladies do,
leastways out here. I fancy it’s the Western men. They
don’t seem to approve of showing too much.”</p>

<p>“Well, I think I’ll rather enjoy startling the natives.
Quick—give me my wrap! I hear Mr. Blake coming. No
controversy here.”</p>

The Coliseum, a large hall over a saloon and garage,
half way between The Hill and The Flat, requisitioned
by all classes when the weather forbade the use of Columbia
Gardens. The walls were covered with the School
colours, copper and green, flags, and college pennants.
The ceiling was a network of electric lights with coloured
globes, copper and green, fluttering paper and sprays of
apple blossoms, brought from far! “Cozy corners” looked
like fragments of a lower altitude, and the faithful palm
was on duty everywhere. The orchestra, on a suspended
balcony in the centre of the room, was invisible within the
same elaborate scheme of decoration.</p>

<p>When Ora entered with her husband the Grand March
had finished and the instruments were tuning for a waltz.
She saw Ida standing directly under the orchestra surrounded
by several men who patently were clamouring
for dances. Even in that great room full of women dressed
from New York and Paris, Ida looked distinctive and
superb. Ora smiled proudly, as she observed her, quite
oblivious that the throng of men and women and indignant
“squabs,” who had been discussing the wife of Gregory
Compton, had transferred their attention to the dazzling
apparition in white. Ida wore her gown of coral silk,
whose flimsiness was concealed under a mist of black
shadow lace. The coral beads clasped her strong white
throat and fell to her supple waist. There was a twist
of coral tulle in her black hair, which was arranged in
the rolling fashion of the moment, obeyed by every other
woman in the room save Ora Blake. And her cheeks, her
lips, were as coral as the fruit of the sea. She had powdered
her face lightly to preserve its tone through exercise
and heat. All the arrogance of youth and beauty and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span>
powerful magnetism was expressed in the high poise of
her head; a faint smile of triumph curved above her little
white teeth; her body was in perfect repose yet as alert as
that of a healthy young cat. The waltz began and she
glided off in the arm of a young mining engineer from
the East. She danced precisely as the best-bred women
in the room danced (early in the evening): ease without
abandon, dignity without stiffness.</p>

<p>“Heavens, but the American woman is adaptable!”
thought Ora. “I never realised before exactly what that
time-worn platitude meant. Probably the standards in the
Ida set are not so different from ours, after all. As for
looks and carriage she might have three generations behind
her. Is it democracy or the actress instinct of woman—permitted
its full development in this country for the
first time in her history?”</p>

<p>This was not entirely a monologue, but addressed for
the most part to Professor Becke, one of the most distinguished
instructors of the School of Mines, and one of the
men she liked best in Butte. He was a tall fair man, with
a keen thin fimbriated face, and long fine hands. Ora
made a point of asking him to dine with her once or twice
a month.</p>

<p>He led the way to two of the chairs on the side of the
hall after she had announced that she did not intend to
dance.</p>

<p>“But this is the first party we have had for weeks,” he
said. “They won’t leave you to me for long.”</p>

<p>“I don’t feel in the mood for dancing. Besides,” she
added with a new daring, “I’m all in white and looking
very white once more; I don’t want to get warm and
spoil the effect.”</p>

<p>He stared into her challenging eyes as if he saw her
for the first time. In that room, full of colour and of
vivid women and young girls, she produced an almost
disconcerting effect with her statuesque beauty, her gleaming
whiteness, her frail white body so daringly displayed
in its white gown. And, oddly enough, to those staring
at her, she made the other women look not only commonplace
but cold.</p>

<p>Ora smiled to herself; she was quite aware of the impression
at work, not only on the scientific brain, but on
others more readily responsive; she had considered the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span>
prudence of practising on Butte before departing for
wider fields.</p>

<p>The Professor changed colour, but replied steadily:
“Fancy you two extraordinary creatures loose in Europe!
You should take a bodyguard. I can understand Compton
giving his consent, for he is the kind of man that wouldn’t
remember whether his wife were twenty or forty at the
end of his honeymoon, and there can be little between them
in any case. But Blake!”</p>

<p>“Oh, we’ll come home without a scandal,” said Ora
lightly. “Ida is the reverse of what she looks, and I—well,
I am the proverbial ‘cold’ American woman—that the
European anathematises. Ida, of course, looks the siren,
and I shall have some trouble protecting her, until
she learns how far she can go. But at least I am forewarned.”</p>

<p>“I fancy you will have more trouble protecting yourself!”
Professor Becke’s voice was not as even as usual.
His intellect was brilliant, and illuminating, and never
more so than when in the society of this young woman
whom heretofore he had admired merely as a vivacious
and exceptional mind; but, startling as this revelation of
subtle and alluring womanhood was, he remembered that
he was no longer young and that he had an admirable
wife with an eagle eye; he had no intention of scorching
his fingers in the attempt to light a flame that would guide
him to the rocks even were he invited to apply the torch.
But he was a man and he sighed a little for his vanished
youth. If he had been twenty years younger he fancied
that he would have forgotten his good lady and risked
burning his heart out. He moved his eyes away deliberately
and they rested on Mark Blake, mopping his scarlet
face after a lively waltz. He was a kindly man, but all
that was deathlessly masculine in him grinned with a
cynical satisfaction.</p>

<p>“Who is that?” asked Ora abruptly, and forgetting a
faint sensation of pique.</p>

<p>“Ah! Who?”</p>

<p>She indicated a man leaning against one of the doorways,
and looking over the crowd with unseeing eyes.
“Heavens! What a jaw! Is he as ‘strong’ as he looks, or
is he one of Bismarck’s wooden posts painted to look like
a man of iron?—Why, it’s——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span>“That is Gregory Compton, and he is no wooden post,
believe me.”</p>

<p>“I haven’t seen him for years. <i>Can</i> any man be as
strong as <i>he</i> looks?”</p>

<p>“Probably not. He hasn’t had time to discover his
master weaknesses yet, so I don’t pretend to guess at them
myself. At present he is too absorbed in squeezing our
poor brains dry——”</p>

<p>“Doesn’t he ever smile?”</p>

<p>“So rarely that the boys, who have a nickname for all
their fellow students, call him ‘Sunny Jim.’”</p>

<p>“What do you think of his wife?” asked Ora abruptly.
She hardly knew why she asked the question, nor why
she felt a secret glow at the expected answer.</p>

<p>The Professor turned his appraising eye upon the substantial
vision in coral and black that tonight had been
pronounced the handsomest woman in Butte. “There
could be no finer example of the obvious. All her goods
are in the front window. There are no surprises behind
that superlative beauty; certainly no revelations.”</p>

<p>“I wonder! Ida is far cleverer than you think, and
quite capable of affording your sex a good deal in the way
of surprises, not to say shocks.”</p>

<p>“Not in the way I mean—not as you will do, worse
luck for my helpless sex. There is no soul there, and, I
fancy, little heart. She is the last woman Gregory Compton
should have married.”</p>

<p>“Why?” Ora tried to look bored but polite.</p>

<p>“Oh—whatever she may have for other men she has
nothing for him. She looks the concentrated essence of
female—American female—egoism. Compton needs a
woman who would give him companionship when he wanted
it, and, at the same time, be willing in service.”</p>

<p>Ora bristled. “Service? How like a man. Are we
still expected to serve men? I thought the world was
moving on.”</p>

<p>Professor Becke, who, like most men married to a domestic
commander-in-chief, was strenuously opposed to
giving women any powers backed up by law, asked with
cold reserve: “Are you a suffragette?”</p>

<p>Ora laughed. “Not yet. But I just escaped being born
in the Twentieth Century. I belong to it at all events.”</p>

<p>“So you do, but you never have been in love——” He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span>
broke off in embarrassment; he had forgotten for the moment
that this white virginal creature had been married
for six years. She showed no resentment, for she barely
had heard him; she was looking at Gregory Compton
again, and concluding that he might appeal strongly to
the supplementary female, but must antagonise women
whose highly specialised intellects, at home only on the
heights of civilisation, had submerged their primal inheritance.</p>

<p>Professor Becke went on:</p>

<p>“Even a clever woman’s best career is a man. If you
women develop beyond nature that powerful old tyrant
will simply snuff you out.”</p>

<p>“Well, man will go too. That may be our final
triumph.”</p>

<p>“Atlantis over again! And quite in order that the
race should perish through the excesses of woman. Then
Nature, having wiped her slate clean with a whoop, will
begin all over again and precisely where she did before.
No doubt she will permit a few records to survive as a
warning.”</p>

<p>“You may be right—but, although I have an idea I shall
one day want to justify my existence by being of some
use, it won’t be because my sex instinct has got the better
of my intelligence. But I refuse to think of that until I
have had a royal good time for a few years.”</p>

<p>“That is your right,” he said impulsively. “You are
altogether exceptional—and you have had six years of
Butte! I am glad your mine has panned out so splendidly.
There is quite an excitement in the Sampling Works——”</p>

<p>“What?” Ora forgot Gregory Compton. “I knew the
mine was doing well——”</p>

<p>“Surely you know that your profits in royalties already
must be something over a hundred thousand dollars——”
He stopped in confusion.</p>

<p>Ora’s face was radiant and she never had liked Mark
as sincerely as at that moment. “It is just like him! He
wanted to wait and give me a great surprise—my husband,
I mean.”</p>

<p>“And I have spoilt it! I am really sorry. Please don’t
tell him.”</p>

<p>“I won’t. And I’ll be the most surprised woman in
the world when he takes me to the bank to sign my letter<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span>
of credit. You needn’t mind. I’ll have the fun of thinking
about it for five months—and rolling it up in my
imagination. Ah!”</p>

<p>“Compton has recognised you, I think.”</p>

<p>Ora had met the long narrow concentrated gaze of
her husband’s friend. She bowed slightly. Compton
made a step forward, hesitated, braced himself, and walked
toward her.</p>

<p>“A constitutionally shy man, but a brave one,” said
Professor Becke with a grim smile, as he rose to resign
his seat. “A strong magnet has pulled up many a sinking
heart. Good evening, Compton. Glad you honour our
party, even if you don’t dance.”</p>

<p>“I intend to ask Mrs. Blake to dance.” Gregory betrayed
nothing of his inner trepidation although he did
not smile. He could always rely upon the stern mask
into which he had trained his visage not to betray him.</p>

<p>Ora, oblivious of her resolution not to dance, rose and
placed her hand on his shoulder, smiling an absent farewell
to Professor Becke. For a moment she forgot her
resentful interest in this man in her astonishment that he
danced so well. She had the impression of dancing with
a light supple creature of the woods, one who could be
quite abandoned if he chose, although he held her as if he
were embracing a feather. She wondered if it were his
drop of aboriginal blood and looked up suddenly. To her
surprise he was smiling, and his smile so altered the immobility
of his face that she lost her breath.</p>

<p>“I feel as if I were dancing with a snowflake,” was his
unexpected remark.</p>

<p>“You look the last man to pay compliments and murmur
sweet nothings.”</p>

<p>“Are you disappointed?”</p>

<p>“Perhaps I am. I rather liked your attitude—expression,
rather—of cool superiority.”</p>

<p>“Why don’t you use the word prig?”</p>

<p>“Oh, no!—Well, perhaps that is what I did mean.”</p>

<p>He stopped short, regardless of the annoyance he caused
several impetuous couples. “If you did I shall leave you
right here.”</p>

<p>“I did not. Please go on. Everybody is staring at us.
You took me completely by surprise.”</p>

<p>“I? Why?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[121]</span>“You are the last man I should expect the usual small
talk from.”</p>

<p>“Small talk? Heavens knows I have none of that.
Girls used to talk my head off in self-defence. I merely
said what I thought. What did you expect me to talk
about?”</p>

<p>“Oh—mines, I suppose.” Again, to her surprise, his
face lit up as if by an inner and jealously hidden torch.
But he said soberly:</p>

<p>“Well, there is no more interesting subject. Never has
been since the world began. Where shall we find a seat?”</p>

<p>The waltz was over. The chairs were filling. Young
couples were flitting toward the embowered corners.</p>

<p>“Let’s go outside,” he said abruptly.</p>

<p>“What? On the street? And nobody goes out of doors
from a ballroom in June.”</p>

<p>“Good reason for going. Come with me.”</p>

<p>He led her to the cloak-room. “Get your wrap,” he
said.</p>

<p>Ora frowned, but she asked for her heavy white woollen
wrap and put it on; then automatically followed him down
the stairs and into the street.</p>

<p>“Why don’t you get your coat and hat?” she asked,
still dazed. “It’s cold, you know.”</p>

<p>“I never was cold in my life,” he said contemptuously.
He hailed a taxi. “I must go up to the School of Mines,
and ask the result of some assaying,” he added as he
almost lifted her in. “Then we can talk up there. May
I smoke?”</p>

<p>“I don’t care what you do.”</p>

<p>He smiled directly into her resentful eyes this time and
tucked the lap-robe about her.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span>

<h3 class="nobreak">XX</h3>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">HE apparently forgot her during the short drive and
stared through the open window of the cab, his
thoughts, no doubt, in the assay room of the School, where
several students, as ardent as himself, were experimenting
with ore they had managed to secure from a recently
opened mine. Ora’s resentment vanished, partly because
she reflected that a new and original experience was a
boon to be grateful for in Butte, but more because she
was thrilled with the sense of adventure. Her woman’s
instinct gave assurance that he had no intention of making
love to her, but it also whispered that, whether she liked
or disliked him when the adventure was over, she would
have something to remember. And it was the first time
she ever had indulged in recklessness. Butte would be by
the ears on the morrow if it learned of her escapade.</p>

<p>When they reached the dark School of Mines he dismissed
the taxi, and said to Ora, “Wait for me here. I
shan’t be a moment.”</p>

<p>He disappeared and Ora shrugged her shoulders and sat
down on the steps. He returned in a few moments and
extended himself over several steps below her.</p>

<p>“Comfortable?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Very!”</p>

<p>“It’s a night, isn’t it?” he asked abruptly.</p>

<p>He was not looking at her but at the low sulphurous
blue sky, with its jewelled lattice, white, yellow, green,
blue. There were no tree tops to rustle, but from the
window below came the voluptuous strains of the Merry
Widow waltz, mingling incongruously with the raucous
noises of the sleepless town: the roaring street-cars, the
blasts of engines, the monstrous purr of motor-cats.</p>

<p>“If we could cut out that jungle,” he said with a sigh.
“Are you warm enough?” He pulled the cloak about
the lower part of her body. “I should have taken the
rug from the cab——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span>“I am warm enough,” she said impatiently, and what
she longed to say was, “How in heaven’s name did you
marry Ida Hook?” He had transferred his gaze to the
city and she studied his face. Then she understood. In
spite of its intense reserve and detachment, its strength
and power, its thin sensitive mouth, it was the most passionate
face she had ever seen. As a matter of fact she
had been at pains to ignore the purely masculine side of
men, her fastidious mind never indulging in comparisons.
She half rose with a sense of panic. Again he looked up
solicitously.</p>

<p>“I am sure you are not comfortable. I could find you
some cushions——”</p>

<p>“Please don’t. So you love beauty?” She was deeply
annoyed with herself, but could think of nothing less
banal. He certainly was not easy to talk to.</p>

<p>“Don’t you? It would be odd if you didn’t. One reason
I brought you up up here was because I wanted to look at
you in the starlight where you belong—the cold starlight—not
in that crowded gaudy room full of mere human
beings.”</p>

<p>“Are you a poet? I have somehow received the impression
that you are a mere walking ambition.”</p>

<p>“I’m no poet if you mean one of those writing fellows.”
His tone expressed unmitigated scorn.</p>

<p>“Well, no doubt you have read a great deal of poetry,
little as one would suspect it.”</p>

<p>“Never read a line of it except when I had to decline
it at school—any more than I’ve ever read a line of fiction.”</p>

<p>“Well, you’ve missed a great deal,” said Ora tartly.
“Poetry is an essential part of the beauty of the world,
which you seem to appreciate. And the best of fiction is
the best expression of current history. What do you think
when you star-gaze?”</p>

<p>“You mean, can I think at all when I haven’t read what
other men have thought?”</p>

<p>“No.—No doubt the most original brains are those that
have not read too much, are not choked up.” Ora made
this admission reluctantly, but he had caught her fairly.
“Tell me at least what the stars suggest to you. About
everything has been said of them that can be said. The
poor old stars have been worked to death.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span>“The stars above Montana are watchfires protecting the
treasure below. Perhaps they are bits of her treasures,
gold, silver, copper, sapphire, that flew upward in the final
cataclysm.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know whether that is poetical or gross materialism.”</p>

<p>“No mines, no poets. Nearly all conquest from the
dawn of history down to the Boer War has had the acquisition
of mineral wealth as its real object. The civilisation
that follows is incidental; it merely means that the
strongest race, which, of course, knows the most, wins. If
ever we have a war with Mexico, what will be the cause?
Mines. Incidentally we will civilise her. Peru, Mexico,
India, the Americas—all have been invaded in their turn
by more civilised nations, and all after plunder. They
gave as much as they took, but little they cared about
that. What opened up California? This great Northwest?
Prospectors in search of gold. Excuse this lecture.
I am the least talkative of men, but you have jarred my
brain, somehow. Read the history of mines and mining
if you want romance.”</p>

<p>“As a matter of fact few things interest me more. I
am so glad my mine has been leased for a year only.
When that is up I am going to mine it myself. I’ll build
a bungalow out there and go down every day. Perhaps
in time I could be my own manager. At all events, think
of the excitement of watching the ore as it comes up the
shaft; of running through a lean vein and coming suddenly
upon a chamber of an entirely different kind of
ore from what you had been taking out. Great shoots
full of free gold! Wire gold! Or that crisp brown-gold
that looks as if it were boiling out of the ore and makes
one want to bite it! Why are you staring so at me?”</p>

<p>His eyes were more widely opened and brilliant than
she had seen them. “Do you mean that?” he asked.
“I’ve a great notion to tell you something that I’ve not
told anyone.”</p>

<p>“Do tell me!”</p>

<p>She leaned down eagerly. She had dismissed the feeling
of panic as something to be forgotten as quickly as possible.
But her brain was on fire to penetrate his. She felt an
extraordinary mental stimulation. But he relapsed into
absolute silence, although he held his head, lowered again,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span>
at an angle that suggested he might be thinking intently.
She moved impatiently, but he sat still, staring downward,
his eyes narrow once more. She noticed irrelevantly how
black his hair was, and her white hand went out stealthily
as if magnetised, but was immediately restored to order.
In the vibrating silence she had another glimmer of understanding.
He wanted to tell her something personal, but
his natural secretiveness and habit of reserve were engaged
in a struggle with the unusual impulse. She shifted the
ground.</p>

<p>“I wish you would tell me something of your boyhood,”
she said abruptly.</p>

<p>He looked up in astonishment. “I never talk about
myself——”</p>

<p>“How very egoistical.”</p>

<p>“Ego——”</p>

<p>“No, I did not say egotistical.”</p>

<p>“Ah!” There was another pause, although he looked
at her with a frown. “I have talked to you more than
I ever talk to anyone,” he said resentfully.</p>

<p>“It is the stars, to say nothing of the isolation. We
might be up on one of your escaped nuggets. Remember
that I have heard of you constantly for six years—and
met you before on one of those occasions when all persons
look alike. How could I escape curiosity?”</p>

<p>“I brought you out to look at in the proper setting. I
can’t say I had any desire to talk to you. I suppose I
should not keep you out here——”</p>

<p>“I am much happier and more comfortable than in that
hot room. But surely you need more recreation. Why
do you never go to dances?”</p>

<p>“Dances? I? I only went tonight——” He, too, apparently,
was determined to keep their respective spouses
out of the conversation, for he veered off quickly. “It is a
sort of religion to attend the Prom even if you only show
yourself. I was about to beat a retreat when I saw you.
Of course it was my duty to shake hands. Besides, I
wanted to see if you were real.” And he smiled up into
her eyes.</p>

<p>“Do you know that we are flirting?”</p>

<p>“Well, let us flirt,” he replied comfortably. “I haven’t
the least idea what it is, but I am not a bit in love with
you, if that is what you mean.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span>Ora drew herself up rigidly. “Well, you are——” she
began, aware that she had a temper. Then she laughed.
Why quarrel with a novel experience? Her anger turned
into a more subtle emotion. She was well aware of the
dazzling brightness of her eyes. She leaned forward and
concentrated her mind in an attempt to project her magnetism
through them, although again with a feeling of
panic; it was too much like the magnet rushing out to the
iron.</p>

<p>He returned that powerful gaze unmoved, although an
expression of perplexity crossed his own eyes. She was
disconcerted and asked lamely:</p>

<p>“Is it true that you used to run away and prospect in
the mountains?”</p>

<p>His face lit up with an enthusiasm her fascinations had
been unable to inspire; and a richer note came into his
voice. “I was eleven the first time and stayed out for six
months. Two years after I ran away again. The next
time I went with my father’s permission. I worked in
one of the Butte mines one summer—but otherwise—well,
you see, there is a good deal to do on a ranch. This is the
first time I have been able to do as I please.”</p>

<p>Ora looked at his long slim figure, his brown hands that
tonight, at least, expressed a sort of cruel deliberate repose.
Whatever they may have been in their ranch days they
were smooth and well cared for now.</p>

<p>“Somehow, I can’t see you handling a pick,” she said
doubtfully. “Is it true that you intend to work in the
mines all summer?”</p>

<p>“Part of it—when I am not working in a mill or a
smelter. I’d be ashamed of myself if I couldn’t do anything
that another man can do. Some of the best miners
look like rats.”</p>

<p>He looked like a highly-bred mettlesome race-horse himself,
and Ora wondered, as she had before tonight: “Where
did he get it? Who were his ancestors?” She had seen
dukes that looked like farm hands, and royal princesses
that might have been upper housemaids, but her feminine
(and American) mind clung to the fallacy that it takes
generations to produce the clean-cut shell. She determined
to look up his family tree in Holland.</p>

<p>“Well—Custer—my housekeeper—will look after you,”
she said as naturally as if her thoughts had not wandered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span>
for a moment. “Shall you do any mining on your own
place before we come back from Europe?”</p>

<p>He started and looked at her apprehensively, then
scowled.</p>

<p>“What is the matter? You may not know it but at this
moment your face looks like an Indian battle-axe.”</p>

<p>To her surprise he laughed boyishly. “You startled
me. I have heard of mind readers. Well, I will tell you
what I wanted to a while back. But you must promise
not to tell—anyone.”</p>

<p>“I promise! I swear it! And do hurry. I’m afraid
you’ll shut up tight again.”</p>

<p>“No, I won’t. I don’t know that I’d tell you were it not
that your own mine is just over the border; we may have
to consolidate some day to save a lawsuit—No, I will be
honest; I really want to tell you. It is this: Close to the
northeast boundary line of my ranch is an almost barren
hill of limestone and granite. Shortly before I left—last
October—I discovered float on the side of the hill. There
is no doubt in my mind that we have both come upon a
new mineral belt, although whether we are in the middle
or on one edge of it is another question.”</p>

<p>He told her the story of the storm and of the uncovering
of the float. Nor did he end his confidence with a bare
statement of fact. He told her of his sensations as he sat
on the ragged ground leaning against the roots of the
slain trees, his mental struggle, and final resolution. Then
he told her of the hopes and dreams of his boyhood, and
what it had meant to him—this sudden revelation that
he had a mine under his feet—and all his own! He talked
for half an hour, with the deep satisfaction that only a
shy and silent person feels when talking into a sympathetic
mind for the first time. Ora listened with a curious
sense of excitement, as if she were overboard in a warm
and pleasant but unknown sea. There were times when
she felt like talking very fast herself. But she did nothing
of the sort, merely jogging him diplomatically when he
showed signs of relapsing into silence. Finally he stopped
in the middle of a sentence and said abruptly:</p>

<p>“That’s all.”</p>

<p>“Oh! And you really have made up your mind not to
begin work for a year?”</p>

<p>“Quite!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[128]</span>“But—have you thought—it is only tonight I learned
that the engineers who leased my mine have struck a rich
vein. Suppose it dips toward yours——”</p>

<p>“It does——”</p>

<p>“Have they put on a big force?”</p>

<p>“Naturally. They are rushing things, as they know they
will not get the mine another year.”</p>

<p>“Well, suppose their vein runs under your hill—through
their side-line?”</p>

<p>He stirred uneasily. “I am watching them. So far
the dip is very slight. It may take a turn, or go down
straight; or,” and he smiled at her again, “it may pinch
out. Nothing is so uncertain as an ore vein.”</p>

<p>“Do you think it will?” asked Ora anxiously.</p>

<p>“No, don’t worry. I was down the other day; and did
some prospecting on my own account besides. I think
you’ve got a big mine.”</p>

<p>“But suppose the vein should take a sudden dip to the
right—you don’t want them burrowing under your hill——”</p>

<p>“They won’t burrow under my hill,” he said grimly.
“I should persuade them that there was an even richer
vein on their left.”</p>

<p>“Is there?”</p>

<p>“I have reason to think so. They naturally would want
to avoid the expenses of a lawsuit, and of course they
would waste a lot of time sinking a shaft or driving across.
Their lease would be pretty well up by the time——”</p>

<p>“You <i>are</i> cold-blooded! What of me? I should be
making nothing, either.”</p>

<p>“You’d make it all later on. How much do you expect
to spend in Europe anyway? You must have made a
thousand dollars a day since the first carload of ore was
smelted.”</p>

<p>She was on the point of replying that a woman could
not have enough money in Europe, when she remembered
the conspiracy to make him believe that a thousand dollars
would cover the expenses of his wife.</p>

<p>“Oh, it is merely that I don’t like being one of the
pawns in your game,” she said.</p>

<p>“You’d have all the more later on. Ore doesn’t run
away.”</p>

<p>“How <i>can</i> you stay away from your mine? I feel—after<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[129]</span>
all that you have told me!—that you are wild to get
at it?”</p>

<p>“So I am! So I am! But I said I wouldn’t and that
is the end of it. I want that last year at the School.”</p>

<p>“What shall you do with all that money—if your hill
turns out to be full of gold? More, I hope, than the rest
of our millionaires have done for Montana—which is exactly
nothing. You might give the State a complete irrigating
system.”</p>

<p>“Good idea! Perhaps I will. But that is in the future.
I want the fun first——”</p>

<p>“Fun? It is the passion of your life, your great romance.
You’ll never love a woman like that.”</p>

<p>“Of course not.” But he was staring at her. He had a
sensation of something swimming in the depths of his
mind, striving to reach the surface. He changed his position
suddenly and sat up. “And you?” he asked. “You
have the same vision. Couldn’t you feel the same absorbing
passion——”</p>

<p>“For ore?” The scorn of her entire sex was in her
voice. “Dead cold metal——”</p>

<p>“Every molecule, every individual atom is alive and
quivering——”</p>

<p>“I am not interested in chemistry.”</p>

<p>He still stared at her. Her cheeks were scarlet, her eyes
blazing. She sprang to her feet.</p>

<p>“Ida is the wife for you! She’ll never ask much of you
and you never could hurt her, not even if you tried, she
is fortunate in lacking just that which you could hurt.”</p>

<p>“What is it?” He spoke eagerly. He, too, had risen,
his eyes still on her face. Unconsciously he held his breath.</p>

<p>“Oh, you wouldn’t understand it I told you—and I
haven’t the least desire to tell you. She will make you
comfortable, do you credit when you are a rich man,
spend your money royally. That is all <i>you</i> will ask of
<i>her</i>. Now, I’ll go back.”</p>

<p>He was a step or two below her. Their eyes were on
a level. He looked at her sombrely for a moment, then
walked past her up the steps.</p>

<p>“You need not call a cab. I shall go home. I should
only set them all talking if I appeared in the ballroom
again. You can tell Mark that I didn’t feel well and that
you took me home.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[130]</span>They walked along the high terrace until they found a
point of easy descent.</p>

<p>“What have I said to make you angry?” he asked.</p>

<p>Ora laughed with determined good humour. “It was
not I. It was merely my sex that flared up. Please forget
it.”</p>

<p>“I want to thank you for what you have done for
Ida,” he said abruptly, and it was evident that the words
cost him more than his former revelations. “It was a
great thing for you to do.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Ida has become my most intimate friend. I have
never enjoyed Butte so much as in these last few months.”</p>

<p>“Has she? And Mark is my best friend.” He jerked
his head in annoyance; manifestly the remark had been
too spontaneous. They were before her gate. She extended
a limp hand, but he held it firmly. He was smiling
again although he looked depressed.</p>

<p>“Do give me a friendly shake,” he said. “I do like you
and you will be going in a few days.”</p>

<p>“I do not go for five months.”</p>

<p>“You can go next week. I’ll square it with Mark.”</p>

<p>“I don’t wish to go next week. Besides, Mark expects
some important people here in the autumn, and needs my
help. He has a deal on.”</p>

<p>“I’ll dispossess Mark of any such notion. It’s all nonsense,
this idea of a man’s needing his wife’s help in business.
It’s a poor sort of man that can’t manage his own
affairs, and Mark is not a poor sort. Now, you are angry
again!”</p>

<p>“That would be foolish of me,” she said icily. “You
merely don’t understand. You never could. Do you want
to get rid of me?” she asked abruptly.</p>

<p>“Yes, I think I do.”</p>

<p>Then Ora relented. She also gave him the smile that
she reserved as her most devastating weapon. “I am
sorry,” she murmured, “but I don’t think I can be ready
for at least three months. Nor Ida.”</p>

<p>“You go next week,” he said.</p>

<p>And go they did.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">GREGORY and Mark established their wives comfortably
in a drawing-room of the limited for Chicago,
asked the usual masculine questions about tickets and trunk
checks, expressed their masculine surprise that nothing
had been forgotten, told them to be careful not to lean
over the railing of the observation car, nor to make themselves
ill with the numerous boxes of candy sent to the
train, admonished them not to spend too much money in
New York, to send their trunks to the steamer the day
before they sailed, and give themselves at least two hours
to get to the docks; above all not to mislay their letters
of credit; then kissed them dutifully, and, as the train
moved out, stood on the platform with solemn faces and
hearts of indescribable buoyancy.</p>

<p>“My Lord!” exclaimed Ida, as she blew her last kiss.
“If Greg was going along I’d have to take care of him
every step of the way. I wouldn’t trust him with the
tickets the length of the train. Men do make me tired.
They keep up the farce that we’re children just to keep
up that other grand farce that they run the Universe. Any
old plank to cling to.”</p>

<p>Ora kept her sentiments to herself.</p>

<p>If Mark, who was fond of his wife, and more or less
dependent upon her, wondered vaguely that he should
rejoice in the prospect of six months of bachelorhood,
Gregory was almost puzzled. Ida was now no more to him
personally than a responsibility he had voluntarily assumed
and was determined to treat with complete justice; but at
least she made him more comfortable than he had ever been
before, and he had trained her to let him alone. Since her
rapid improvement her speech had ceased to irritate him;
she was never untidy, never anything but a pleasant picture
to look at. He had also noted on the night of the
party that she was indisputably the handsomest woman in
the room and received the homage of men with dignity and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[132]</span>
poise. He had felt proud of her, and comfortably certain
that he could trust her. Altogether a model wife.</p>

<p>Nevertheless as he walked out Park Street after he left
Mark at his office (Ida not only had sent his personal
possessions to the Blake house but found time to unpack
and put them away) his brain, which had been curiously
depressed during the past week, felt as if full of effervescing
wine.</p>

<p>“Jove!” he thought, “why do men marry? What has
any woman living to give a man half as good as his freedom.”</p>

<p>His freedom was to be reasonably complete. He had
told Ida to expect no letters from him and not to write
herself unless she were in trouble. With all the fervour of
his masculine soul he hated to write letters. Long since
he had bought a typewriter, on which he rattled off necessary
business communications so briefly that they would
have cost him little more on the wire. He knew that he
should hear constantly of his wife’s welfare from Mark,
and had no desire to be inflicted with descriptions of
scenery and shops.</p>

<p>He felt a spasm of envy, however, as he thought of the
letters Mark would receive from Ora. <i>Her</i> letters, no
doubt, would be worth reading, not only because she
had a mind, and already had seen too much of Europe
to comment on its obvious phases, but because they would
be redolent of her subtle exquisite personality. He had
once come upon a package of old letters among his mother’s
possessions and read them. They had been written by his
great-great-grandmother to her husband while he was a
soldier in the War of the Revolution. It was merely the
simple life of the family, the farm, and the woods, that
she described, but Gregory never recalled those letters without
feeling again the subtle psychological emanation of the
writer’s sweet and feminine but determinate personality;
it hovered like a wraith over the written words, imprisoned,
imperishable, until the paper should fall to dust. So, he
imagined, something of Ora’s essence would take wing on
the rustling sheets of her letters.</p>

<p>But the spasm of envy passed. Ora would write no such
letters to Mark Blake. Her correspondence with her husband
would be perfunctory, practical, brief. To some man
she might write pages that would keep him up at night,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[133]</span>
reading and rereading, interpreting illusive phrases,
searching for hidden and personal meanings, while two
individualities met and melted.... But this yearning
passed also. To receive such letters a man must answer
them and that would be hell.</p>

<p>He was on his way to change his clothes for overalls
and get his blue dinner pail, well filled, from Custer. But
before he reached the house he conceived an abrupt and
violent distaste for life underground, an uncontrollable
desire—or one which he made no effort to control—for long
rides over the ranch, and a glimpse of Limestone Hill. It
was seven months since he had seen his ranch save in
snatches, and he wanted it now for months on end. He was
not a town-bred man, and he suddenly hated the sight of
Butte with her naked angles and feverish energies. He
realised also that his mind insistently demanded a rest.
To be sure he had intended to work in the mines for eight
hours of the day, but he had planned to study for ten.
Well, he would have none of it! Caprice was no characteristic
of his, but he felt full of it this brilliant morning.
If the air was so light in Butte that his feet seemed barely
to touch the ground, so clear that the mountains seemed
walking down the valley, what must it be in the country?</p>

<p>He went rapidly to the house, left a message for Mark,
packed a suit-case and took the next train for Pony. There
he hired a horse and rode to his ranch.</p>

<p>One of the sudden June rains had come while he was
in the train. It had ceased, but a mass of low clouds
brushing the higher tree tops was almost black. Their
edges were silver: they were filled with a cold imprisoned
sunlight, which transformed the distant mountains into
glass, transparent, with black shadows in their depths.
Montana looked as giving an exhibition of her astral body.
But as he rode the clouds drifted away, the sky deepened
to the rich voluptuous blue of that high altitude; even
the grey soil showing through the thin grass of the granite
hills looked warmer. Where the soil was thicker the
ground was covered with a gorgeous tapestry of wildflowers;
the birds sang desperately as if they knew how short
was their springtime, affected like mortals by the thin
intoxicating air. Even the waters in the creek roared as
if making the most of their brief span. The mountains
lost their glassy look; blue, ice-topped, they were as full<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span>
of young and vivid life as when they danced about, heedless
that the heaving earth purposed they should wait for
centuries before settling into things of beauty for unborn
man to admire. They never will look old, those mountains
of Montana; man may take the treasure from their veins
and the jewels from their crowns, but they drink forever
the elixir of the air. The blue dawn fills their spirit with
a deathless exultation, the long blue-gold days their bodies
with immortal life, the starry nights, swinging their lamps
so close to the snow fields, unroll the dramas of other
worlds. They are no mere masses of rock and dirt or
even of metal, these mountains of Montana, but man’s
vision of eternal youth.</p>

<p>Gregory drew rein on the crest of one of his own hills.
Below lay the De Smet ranch, and he drew a long breath
with that sensation of serene pride which comes to men
when they contemplate their landed possessions, or their
wives on state occasions. All the arable soil, on flat and
hillside, was green; alfalfa, with its purple flowers, filled
the bottoms; the winter wheat was rippling in the wind;
the acres covered with the tender leaves of young flax were
like a densely woven lawn. On the hills and the public
range roamed his cattle. All of this fair land, including
its possible treasure, was his, absolutely. By the terms of
his father’s will he paid yearly dividends from the sale
of steers and crops to three aunts, now reduced to two.
Whether by accident or design, Mr. Compton had omitted
all mention of “minerals under the earth.” Gregory had
not the least objection to making these ladies rich, when
his mines yielded their wealth, but he was jealous of every
acre of his inheritance, far more of its secrets. All the
passionate intensity of his nature he had poured out on
his land and its subterranean mysteries, and he would have
hailed an invention which would enable him to dismiss
every man from his employ. But his head was hard and
he always smiled grimly at the finish of his fanciful desires.</p>

<p>He turned his horse toward the distant group of farm
buildings, then wheeled abruptly and rode toward Limestone
Hill. He had anticipated a long talk with the enthusiastic
Oakley on the subject of crops, but he suddenly
realised that he was in no mood to talk to anyone and
that his secret reason for coming to the ranch was to visit<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[135]</span>
his hill. Oakley would cling to him for hours. One glance
had assured him that the crops would have satisfied a state
experimental farm. Mining would fascinate him in its
every detail, but as far as agriculture was concerned, he
was interested only in results.</p>

<p>As he rode toward the hill he frowned at the signs of
activity on the other side of his boundary line. A large
gasoline hoist had been installed. The waste dump was
almost as high as a hill, four “double-sixes”—six-horse
teams—stood waiting to be loaded from the ore bins.
There were a group of miners’ cabins, a long mess-house,
and a blacksmith’s shop. This was the only shadow on
his future: he wanted no lawsuits, nor did he want to enter
into partnership with anyone, not even Ora Blake.</p>

<p>But he dismissed the matter from his mind, tied his
horse, and, although Montanans are a slow race on foot
out of deference to the altitude, ran up the hill. A glance
told him that his secret was undiscovered. He knelt
down and dug up the float, his heart hammering. And
then he deliberately let the prospector’s fever take possession
of him. The soles of his feet prickled as if responding
to the magnets below; he had a fancy that gold, molten,
was running through his veins. But his brain worked
clearly. He was aware that his exultation and excitement
were not due to the lure of gold alone, but to the still more
subtle pleasure that a strong and obstinate nature feels in
breaking a vow and deliberately succumbing to temptation.
He had vowed in good faith that he would not open
his mine until the third of June of the following year.
But a week before he had spent an enchanted hour with a
woman, and during the rest of that night—he had walked
half way to Silver Bow and back—he had wanted that
woman more than he had ever wanted anything on earth.
He had forgotten his mine.</p>

<p>At first he had lashed himself with scorn, remembering
his infatuation for the woman he had married. He felt
something of the indignant astonishment of the small boy
who imagines himself catching a second attack of measles,
before he discovers it is scarlet fever. But it took him
only a brief time to realise that the passion inspired by
Ora Blake was so much deeper and more various than
the blind subservience to Nature that had driven him to
Ida (who had not the least idea of being a tool of Nature<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[136]</span>
herself) that it was far more dangerous than the first inevitable
attack of youthful madness could ever be. It
humiliated his pride to have been the mere victim of
the race, the rudimentary male swept into matrimony by
the first woman who combined superlative femaleness with
virtue. Then he wondered if he could have loved Ora at
that time; he certainly felt ten years older today.</p>

<p>The word love brought him to his senses. It was formidable
and definite. While he had believed himself to be in
the throes of a second fever caught from a beautiful
woman’s concordant magnetism, he had felt merely disgusted
at his weakness, not in the least disloyal to his
closest friend, whom he knew no woman could tempt him to
betray. But he realised with hideous abruptness that if
he were thrown with Ora Blake for any length of time she
would become so necessary to him through the comprehensive
appeal, which he only half understood, that he no
more could pluck her out of him by the roots, as men disposed
of the superficial passion when it became inconvenient,
than he could tear the veins out of his hill with
his hands.</p>

<p>He had felt the danger dimly when with her, although
he had made up his mind even then to get her out of
Montana as quickly as possible. He vowed anew, with
the first sensation of panic he had ever experienced, that
the same sky should not cover them a week hence. He
knew his influence over Mark Blake.</p>

<p>Then he made a deliberate attempt to banish the subject
from his mind, ordering his thoughts to their favorite
haunts underground. But one little insidious tract, so
difficult to control in all brains still young and human,
showed a disposition to create startling and vivid pictures,
to dream intensely, to cast up this woman’s face, fling it
into his consciousness, with an automatic regularity that
was like a diabolical challenge to his haughty will.</p>

<p>He endeavoured to think of Ora with contempt: she had
married a good fellow, but one whom she must have been
compelled by the circumstances of her life to regard as her
social inferior, and who assuredly was in no sense suited
to her—merely from a parasitic dread of poverty. Other
women went to work, even if delicately nurtured. But he
was too masculine and too little influenced by certain
phases of modern thought to condemn any woman long for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[137]</span>
turning to man in her extremity. Privately he detested
women that “did things”; better for them all to give some
man the right to protect them: marriage with a good fellow
like Mark Blake, even without love, spoilt them far less
than mixing up with the world in a scramble for bread.
It would have spoilt Ora, who was now merely undeveloped;
hardened, sharpened, coarsened her. He dismissed
his abortive attempt to despise her; also a dangerous
tendency to pity her.</p>

<p>Before he finished his tramp he had recaptured his poise.
What a woman like Ora Blake might have to give him he
dared not think of, nor would he be betrayed again into
speculation. Doubtless it was all rubbish anyway, merely
another trick of the insatiable mating instinct. If it were
more—the primal instinct plus the almost equally insistent
demands of the civilised inheritances in the brain—so
much the worse, the more reason to “cut it out.” But
when he returned to the cottage in East Granite Street he
threw himself on the divan in the parlour and slept there.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">XXII</h3>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THEREFORE was he in no mood to fight another
temptation; rather to take a sardonic pleasure in succumbing.
An hour later, in overalls, and assisted by two
of his labourers, outwardly more excited than he, for they
had worked underground and vowed they smelt ore, he
was running an open cut along the line of the float. As
there was no outcropping it was mere guesswork; it might
be weeks before he struck any definite sign of an ore body,
but he was prepared to level the hill if necessary. Until
he did come upon indications that would justify the expense,
however, he was resolved not to sink a shaft nor
drive a tunnel.</p>

<p>They used pick and shovel until at the depth of eight
feet they struck rock. Gregory had been prepared for this
and sent the unwilling but interested Oakley into Pony
for drills and powder. For two days more they drilled
and blasted; then—Gregory took out his watch and noted
the hour, twenty-three minutes after four—one of the men
gave a shout and tossed a fragment into the air.</p>

<p>“Stringer, by jinks!” he cried. “And it’s copper carbonate
or I’m a dead ’un.”</p>

<p>Gregory frowned, but laid the bit of ore gently on his
palm and regarded it with awe. He wanted gold, but at
least this was his, and the first of his treasure to be torn
from its sanctuary. For a moment the merely personal
longing was lost in the enthusiasm of the geologist, for the
fragment in his hand was very beautiful, a soft rich
shaded green flecked with red; the vugs, or little cells,
looked as if lined with deep green velvet.</p>

<p>But he turned and stared at the mining camp beyond
his boundary line. One of the bits of float he had found
last year had been gold quartz. Had it travelled, a mere
chip, from the original body to this distant point, or
danced here on the shoulders of an earthquake? Float,
even under a layer of soil was often found so far from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[139]</span>
the ore body, that it was a more fallible guide than a prospector’s
guess. He walked to the end of the hill, while
his miners shrugged their shoulders and resumed the
drilling.</p>

<p>The great vein of the Primo mine was dipping acutely to
the right. Might it not be wise for him to abandon his
present position and sink a shaft close to the line, trusting
to his practical knowledge and highly organized faculty to
strike the vein?</p>

<p>He stood for half an hour debating the question, listening
to the intermittent roar of the engine, the rattle of ore
dumped from the buckets. Then he walked back to the
red gash in his own land. It would be the bitterest disappointment
of his life if he failed to find gold in his hill,
but the dominant voice in his brain was always practical,
and it advised him to follow the willing metal for the
present instead of incurring the expense of a shaft and
possible litigation.</p>

<p>“’Nother stringer!” announced one of the men, as
Gregory arrived at the long deep cut. “Guess it’s time
for a windlass.”</p>

<p>“Guess it is. Go down to the house and get some
lumber.”</p>

<p>He descended into the cut and looked at the unmistakable
evidence of little veins. Were they really stringer,
tentacles of a great ore body climbing toward the surface,
or a mere series of independent and insignificant veins not
worth exploiting? He was in a pessimistic mood, but
laughed suddenly as he realised how disappointed he would
be should further excavation demonstrate there was no
chamber of copper ore below.</p>

<p>Four hours later the windlass was finished and four
men were at work. At the end of the fortnight the windlass
had been discarded in favor of a gasoline hoist, and
twenty-five men in three shifts were employed upon a
chamber of copper carbonate ore. The nearest of the De
Smet hills began to take on the appearance of a mining
camp; a mess-house and a number of cabins were building.
Trees were falling, not only to make room for the new
“town” but to timber the mine when the time came to
sink or drift. At present those of the miners that could
not be housed by the disgusted Oakley occupied tents or
rude shacks. Oakley spent the greater part of his time<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[140]</span>
escorting the great six-horse teams from the ranch to the
public road, as their drivers showed an indifference to
his precious crops only rivalled by Gregory Compton’s.</p>

<p>Mark took a week’s vacation after the first carload of
ore had been shipped from Pony to the sampling works in
Butte and netted $65 a ton. Gregory, who was working
with his men, far too impatient and surcharged with
energy to walk about as mere manager, paid scant attention
to him during the day; but Mark was content to sit
on the edge of the cut and smoke and calculate, merely
retreating in haste when the men lit the fuses.</p>

<p>On the third morning, as he was approaching the mine
at dawn with his host, Gregory suddenly announced his
intention of sending for a manager; he purposed to sink
a shaft on the edge of the chamber in order to determine if
the present lode was the top of a vein.</p>

<p>“Better take off your coat and go to work,” he added.
“Do you good. You’re getting too fat.”</p>

<p>“Getting? Thanks. But I don’t mind. You’ve got
several hundred thousand dollars in that chamber by
the looks of things, but I suppose that wouldn’t satisfy
you?”</p>

<p>“Lord, no. That is merely the necessary capital to
mine the entire hill—or fight the powers that be when
they get on to the fact that I’ve got another Anaconda.”</p>

<p>“Do you believe it? Big pockets have been found in
solitary splendor before this.”</p>

<p>“This hill is mineral from end to end,” said Gregory
with intense conviction. “And I want to get to the main
lode as quickly as possible.”</p>

<p>“By the way,” said Mark abruptly, “why don’t you
locate your claim?”</p>

<p>“Locate? Why, the land’s mine. Patent is all right.
My father even patented several placer claims——”</p>

<p>“Mining laws are fearful and wonderful things. Judges,
with a fat roll in their pockets, have been known to make
fearful and wonderful interpretations before this. If
you’ve struck a new copper belt—well, the enemy has billions.
Better stake off the entire hill, and apply for patents.
You may be grey before you get them, but the application
is enough——”</p>

<p>“It would cost a lot of money, and I don’t like the idea
of paying twice over. This is costing thousands——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[141]</span>“And you’ll soon be taking out thousands a week. But
if you need it all I’ll lend you the money. It would be a
good investment for Ora. You can pay me four per cent.
I’ve a mind to go ahead today and begin staking off.”</p>

<p>Gregory stood still with his head inclined at the angle
which indicated that he was concentrating his mind.
“Very well,” he said curtly. “Go ahead. And I don’t
need your money. Stake off every inch of the hill and
have a good map made. See that the side lines are flush
with the boundary. Of course I’d never have any trouble
with you, but Mrs. Blake might take it into her head to
sell. Get out a surveyor when you’re ready for him.
Don’t bother me until the thing is done.”</p>

<p>Mark took a longer vacation and worked off some twenty
pounds. He wished ruefully that Ora would return suddenly,
for he doubted that his love of good living would
undo the excellent work when he was once more in Butte.
He employed a U. S. deputy mineral surveyor, the map
was made, Gregory applied for his patents; the lawyers’s
mind was at rest for the present, although he kept his ears
open in Butte.</p>

<p>Gregory sank his shaft ostensibly to determine the dip
and width of the vein leading from the chamber, but
secretly with the hope of meeting the body of ore already
uncovered in the Primo Mine. He was elated with his
splendid “find” and sudden wealth, but his old dream
never left him for a moment. Indeed he would have been
more than willing to miss the pyroxenite if he could come
upon a lode of quartz containing free gold. That was what
he had visualised all his life. He wanted to stand in his
own stopes and flash his lantern along glittering seams,
not merely send masses of decomposed grey-black ore to
the sampling works and await returns. If he found a vein
worth the outlay he would erect his own stamp mill and
listen to its music. Such is the deathless boy that exists
in all men. Mere wealth meant far less to him than the
beautiful costly toy to play with for a while.</p>

<p>The shaft at the end of a month had gone down eighty
feet; but had revealed only a lean vein of copper
carbonates which made him forget his dreams in the
fear that his mine was pinching out. But he persisted,
and one morning when he went to the bottom of the shaft
after the smoke of the blast had cleared away, and lit his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[142]</span>
candle, he picked up a lump of yellow ore that glittered
like quartz packed with free gold. For a moment his head
swam. He knelt down and brushed the shattered rock from
several other bits of what looked like virgin gold; and he
caressed them as gently as if they had been the cheek of
his first born. But he was a geologist. He stepped into
the ascending bucket a prey to misgivings. As soon as he
examined his treasure in the sunlight he knew it at once
for chalcopyrite—the great copper ore of the sulphide
zone.</p>

<p>After he had assayed it he philosophically dismissed regret.
It ran $26 in copper with slight values of gold
and silver. Chalcopyrite ore, as a rule, runs about five
per cent. in copper, its commercial value lying in the immense
quantities in which it may be found, although it is
necessary to concentrate at the mine. If he had struck
one of the rare veins of massive chalcopyrite, averaging
$25 a ton, he would take out, after it was sufficiently developed,
several thousand dollars a day; and, like the
carbonates, it could go straight to the smelter. As a
matter of fact the vein when uncovered proved to be six
feet wide and grew slightly broader with depth. The
miners were jubilant over their “fool’s gold”, and a number
of people came out and asked for the privilege of
looking at what the foreman, Joshua Mann, declared to be
the prettiest pay streak in Montana.</p>

<p>Gregory found his chalcopyrite during the third month
after he began to investigate the hill. The chamber already
had netted him over a hundred thousand dollars and
grew richer with depth. He put an extra force at work on
the promising shoot.</p>

<p>In the Primo Mine the luck varied. The two engineers,
Osborne and Douglas, exhausted the first lode, struck a
poor vein, averaging ten dollars a ton, then ran into a body
of the ore netting as high as four hundred dollars. Two
months later they came up suddenly against a wall of
country rock. Undaunted, they drove through the mass,
and struck a lean shoot of chalcopyrite.</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap">“WELL, what do you know about that?”</p>

<p>Mark’s feet were on the table in the cabin Gregory
had had built for himself on the top of the hill. The news
had just been brought to them by one of the men who had a
faithful friend in the Primo Mine.</p>

<p>Gregory was engaged in biting a cigar to pieces. He
waited some ten minutes before replying, during which
Mark smoked philosophically. “I think this,” he said
finally, “what those fellows are after is gold, not copper.
Better suggest to them to get out an expert geologist—Holmes
is a good friend of mine—who will tell them to
sink a shaft over on the right, or run a drift from the
original stope. All we need is time.”</p>

<p>“I’m on. But will they do it? They’re not fools and
what they’re after mainly is cash.”</p>

<p>“I think they’ll listen to reason. They’re not far from
the boundary line and there’s no possible doubt that the
vein apexes here. The moment they cross the line I’ll get
out an injunction. That would stop them anyhow, hold
them up until their lease had expired. And their chance
is good to recover the vein on the other side. No doubt it
has faulted. Have you noticed those aspens about a hundred
yards beyond their shaft? Where there are aspens
there is water. Now as there is no water in sight it must
be below the surface, and that would indicate faulting.
There might be no ore on the other side, but the chance
is worth taking. Better have a talk with Osborne tomorrow.
He’s the least mulish of the two.”</p>

<p>“Good. I might offer them some inducement—give
them an extra month or two. Even so we’d win out. But
they’re not the only danger ahead. How long since you’ve
been in Butte?”</p>

<p>“Not since I began work.”</p>

<p>“Well, let me tell you that Amalgamated is buzzing.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[144]</span>
They’ve got on to the fact good and plenty that you’ve
got the biggest thing in copper that has been struck in
Montana for twenty years. Of course they get figures
regularly from the sampling works. They know you’ve
already taken out half a million dollars worth of ore—net—and
that the new shoot is getting richer every minute.
They’re talking loud about spoiling the market and
all the rest of it. Of course that’s rank nonsense. What
worries them is a rival in Montana. If your mine was in
Colorado or Michigan they wouldn’t care shucks. You
haven’t taken out enough yet to worry them about the
market. But if they can queer your game they’ll do it.
Lucky for you the smelting works need copper just now
as badly as you need them. If it were not for that strike
in the Stemwinder and the Corkscrew you might be having
trouble.”</p>

<p>Gregory smiled, but as he set his jaw at the same time it
was not an agreeable smile. “I’m in a mood to fight somebody—and
win. I wanted gold and didn’t get it. A row
with Amalgamated would relieve my feelings—although
I’d rather use my fists.”</p>

<p>“They’re mad, too, because you’ve named your mine
‘Perch of the Devil.’ That’s the old name for Butte, and
they look upon it as a direct challenge.”</p>

<p>“So it is. And you don’t suppose I’d call my mine
Limestone Hill, do you? I shouldn’t get half the fun
out of it. What the devil can they do, anyhow?”</p>

<p>“That’s what I’m worrying about. You never know
what Amalgamated has up its sleeve. There was just one
man who was too much for them—for a while—and that
was Heinze. And they got him in the end. I believe you’d
give them a run for their money, and I don’t rank you
second to Heinze or any other man when it comes to
brains or resource. But—well, they’ve got billions—and
the best legal talent in the state.”</p>

<p>“You deserve a return compliment. You may consider
yourself counsel for Perch of the Devil Mine.”</p>

<p>“Jimminy! But I’d like a chance at them.” Mark’s
cigar was burning his fingers but he only felt the fire in
his brain. “Do you mean it?”</p>

<p>“Who else? Watch them. Put spies on them. Fight
them with their own weapons. They’ve spies among my
miners. That doesn’t worry me a bit. I merely mention<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[145]</span>
it. Let’s change the subject. I’ve got to sleep tonight.
What’s the news from Europe?”</p>

<p>“I’ve got Ora’s last letter here; want to hear it?”</p>

<p>“Good Lord, no. Tell me what they are doing. I sent
Ida five thousand dollars a few days ago, so I suppose
they’re flying high. She cabled her thanks and said they
were both well.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you really know what they’ve been doing?”</p>

<p>“Not a thing.”</p>

<p>“Well—let’s see. They went over in June. They did
France, Germany—lot of places in regulation tourist style—incidentally
met several of Mrs. Stratton’s old friends.
Then they went back to Paris, where they appear to have
indulged in an orgy of clothes preparatory to a round of
country house visits on the Continent and in England.
Ora writes with great enthusiasm of—er—Ida’s improvement.
Says you’d think she’d been on top all her life, especially
since she got those Paris duds, and met a lot of
smart people; makes a hit with everybody, and will astonish
Butte when she comes back.”</p>

<p>“That will please her!” He felt no glow of tenderness,
but some satisfaction that he could gratify the ambitions
of the woman he had married. He was still too keen on
his own youthful dreams, and thankful at their partial
fulfillment, not to sympathise with those of others.</p>

<p>Mark left him to accept the more commodious hospitality
of Oakley, and Gregory sat for another hour smoking,
hoping for the mood of sleep. But the news had excited
him, and he preferred to sit up rather than to toss about
his narrow bed. The last part of the conversation, however,
had given a new turn to his thoughts. Suddenly,
unbidden, Ora flashed into his mind and refused to be
dislodged. He walked up and down, striving to banish her
as he had done before, when, sleepless, she had peremptorily
demanded his attention. Tonight she was almost a
visible presence in the little room.</p>

<p>He sat down again and grimly permitted his mind to
dwell upon his long communion with her on the steps of
the School of Mines. He tried to analyse his impulse to
take her there. Unconventional as he was it had never
occurred to him to do such a thing before, and there were
twenty women in the room whom he would have expected
to exercise a more potent fascination had he been in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[146]</span>
humour for a flirtation. He had been quite honest in
telling Ora that he had taken her out merely to look at
her under the stars, and in intimating that to make love
to her was the last thing in his mind. She had hardly
seemed a woman at all there in the ballroom or when he
first sat at her feet; his mind was relaxed and the “queer”
romantic or poetical streak that he often deprecated had
taken possession of it; if he had had a suspicion of anything
more he would have fled from her at once, for she
was the wife of his friend. As it was he merely had dismissed
Mark from his mind and tried the experiment of
setting a bit of exquisite white poetry to the music of the
stars....</p>

<p>As often as her memory had assailed him he had longed
to rehearse that scene; the conversation, desultory and personal;
her white profile against the flaming blue sky; the
intensity and brilliancy of her eyes, so unlooked for in her
young almost colorless face; her pink mouth that changed
its expression so often; her curious magnetism, so unlike
that of the full-blooded woman—all of that and something
more; the strange community of mind—or soul?—that
had drawn him on to pour out his secret self into another
self of whose contact he was almost literally sensible,—in
a sudden desire for comprehension that had been like
the birth of a new star in his mental constellation. He
had felt the thrill of her sympathy, her understanding,
then another thrill of perplexity, fear; then the little quarrel,
when he had thought her more adorable than ever,
and no longer bearing the least resemblance to a star-wraith,
but wholly feminine. When he left her it was
with the confused sense that he had sojourned for a bit
with the quintessence of womanhood whom Nature had
cast in a new and perilous mould.</p>

<p>He went over the hour again and again, hoping to bore
himself, to arrive at the conclusion that it had been a mere
commonplace flirtation with a coquette who was as cold as
she looked. But he found the recaptured scene very sweet.
The power of concentration he possessed enabled him to
shut out the little room and sit at the feet of the woman
whose magic personality had penetrated the barriers he
so jealously had built about his soul and given him the
first sense of companionship he had ever known.</p>

<p>He was filled with a longing that shook him and hurt<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[147]</span>
him, to feel that sense of sympathetic companionship, of
spiritual contact, again. And far more. He knew that
she had loved no man, that all the glory and the riches
within her were waiting—and if she had waited, and he
had waited, and they had met unfettered that night——</p>

<p>He sprang to his feet. His face in the smoky light
looked black.</p>

<p>“God!” he muttered. “God! Have I fallen as low as
that? If ever I think of her again I’ll cut my heart out.
I hope to God the Amalgamated puts up the hell of a
fight. What I want is a man’s work in the world, not a
play actor’s.”</p>

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[148]</span>

<h3 class="nobreak">XXIV</h3>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">A WEEK later, Gregory, who was down in the bottom
of the shaft, received a message by way of a descending
miner that a gentleman from Butte, one Mr. John
Robinson, requested the favour of an interview, and
awaited him in the cabin on the top of the hill. At least
such is the polite translation of the message as delivered:
“Say, Boss, there’s a guy upstairs in your shack what says
he’s from Butte, and’s come out to have a chin with you—some
important. Says his name is John Robinson.”</p>

<p>Gregory swore under his breath and for a minute his
face looked ugly and formidable. But as he stepped into
the bucket and gave the signal he permitted his expression
to change to one of grim amusement. Mr. Robinson was
one of the brilliant galaxy that guided the legal footsteps
of “Amalgamated”; that powerful company, financed by
Standard Oil, which owned thirty-one of the mines of
Butte openly, and exerted a power in Montana far exceeding
that of state or nation.</p>

<p>Gregory wore corduroy trousers and coat, and these as
well as his face and hands were white with “muck”, a
mixture of rock-dust and water which spattered everyone
in the vicinity of the ore drills; but he wasted no time to
clean up before climbing to his cabin to meet the ambassador
from Amalgamated.</p>

<p>Mr. Robinson, a portly gentleman, still young, but manifestly
the victim of easy fortune, rose from his chair before
the stove and greeted his host with beaming smile and
extended hand.</p>

<p>“My dear Mr. Compton!” he exclaimed. “It is a great
pleasure to meet you again. Of course you have forgotten
me for I was two grades above you in the High, when you
were a little chap——”</p>

<p>“What have you come here for? Out with it! I’ve no
time to waste. Sit down if you like.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[149]</span>Mr. Robinson colored angrily. He knew little of the
man with whom he had come to deal, but had always relied
upon his urbanity and Western heartiness to “make a
hit.” He knew Mark Blake and, although he had heard,
like others, of Gregory Compton’s record at the School of
Mines, he had assumed that he was a mere student, and in
other respects more or less the same sort of man as his
chum. This man looked unlike any he had ever met.
He concealed his chagrin, however, and resumed his seat.</p>

<p>“Really, Mr. Compton, you are somewhat abrupt——”</p>

<p>“Get down to business. What does Amalgamated
want?”</p>

<p>Mr. Robinson wisely took the cue.</p>

<p>“To buy you out.”</p>

<p>“How much will they pay?”</p>

<p>“How much do you want?”</p>

<p>“What do they offer?”</p>

<p>“Well, between you and me. I fancy they might go as
high as a hundred thousand.”</p>

<p>“Tell them to go to hell.”</p>

<p>“How much do you want?”</p>

<p>“A hundred millions.”</p>

<p>“Good God, man, are you mad!”</p>

<p>“If you had permitted me to finish. I should have added—in
other words, nothing. There isn’t money enough inside
of Montana, let alone on top, to buy one acre of this
ranch.”</p>

<p>“But—you know what most mines are—pockety—yours
may peter out any minute.”</p>

<p>“All right. I take the chances.”</p>

<p>“The history of Butte Hill is unique. There will never
be another——”</p>

<p>“How do you know?”</p>

<p>“It stands to reason——”</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>“Oh, Lord, man, if you are indulging in wild
dreams——!”</p>

<p>“My dreams concern no one but myself. I’m satisfied
with my hill and that’s all there is to it.”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid not. Look here, you are a fine young fellow
with a big future—people talk a lot about you—I don’t
want to see you crushed——”</p>

<p>“You won’t.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[150]</span>“I’m not here to make threats, but you are not so—ah—unsophisticated
as to imagine that if Amalgamated sets
out to get rid of you, you can stand up against them?”</p>

<p>“They can’t do a damned thing and you know it. They
might have a few years ago, when a roll could be passed on
the street to a judge who was to deny or grant an injunction
within a few hours, and at a time when there was no
prospect of the referendum and recall; when the people
of Montana took the buying and selling of men in the
legislature as part of the game, all in the day’s work.
But Montana has caught the reform spirit that has been
sweeping over the rest of the country, and she is also getting
pretty sick of corporation power. Now, sir, not only
have I a clear title to this ranch, but I’ve staked off the
entire hill and applied for patents. If Amalgamated
freezes me out of Anaconda and Great Falls, I’ll promote
a company and put up a plant of my own. With nearly a
million dollars in sight besides what I’ve taken out, you
can figure, yourself, how much trouble I’d have in New
York getting all the money I wanted. Amalgamated
knows that, and my ore will continue to be smelted in
Anaconda. Of course if I were within a mile or so of
Butte I might be in some danger. They’d bore through
and then claim that my ore vein apexed in one of their
properties. But I’m too far away for that.”</p>

<p>Gregory saw the other man’s eyes flash wide open before
they were hastily lowered. Mr. Robinson regarded the
point of his cigar.</p>

<p>“Ah, yes,” he said. “That’s all very true. Luck is
with you in a measure, but—well, take my advice and don’t
fight Amalgamated. They have in their employ some of
the most resourceful brains in the country—that are always
on the job. Heinze taught them a lesson they’ll never forget.”</p>

<p>“Let’s drop the subject.” Gregory rose and opened a
cupboard. “Have something?”</p>

<p>He poured whiskey into two glasses. The men smiled as
they drank, Gregory sardonically, Mr. Robinson ruefully
but with thoughtful eyes. He had what Ida called the
quick-rich face, large and round and fat, and it was an
admirable mask.</p>

<p>“Like to see the mine?” asked Gregory.</p>

<p>“Why, yes—do you mean it?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[151]</span>“Why not? If it had any secrets your spies would have
turned them over before this. Glad to show it to you.”</p>

<p>They went to the shafthead and descended in one of the
buckets.</p>

<p>“How far down have you gone?” asked Mr. Robinson,
with an air of polite interest.</p>

<p>“We found chalcopyrite at one hundred and ten feet,
after a narrow vein leading from the chamber near the
surface, and are stoping.”</p>

<p>As they left the bucket they were greeted by the cheerful
rhythmical sound of hammers on the drills, and by
the light of the miners’ candles they saw the men working
at different points of the dark chamber, two on a scaffolding
above.</p>

<p>“Great waste of labor,” said Gregory. “I shall install
a compressor before long as well as electric lighting. Of
course it is only the beginning of a mine.”</p>

<p>He saw the ambassador from Amalgamated smile, and
turned on his heel. “They’ll be loading the holes in a
minute,” he said. “And I’d like to show you the upper
chamber.”</p>

<p>When they reached the surface Mr. Robinson declined
to go down into the excavation, but stood on the edge
watching the busy hive below. “Great sight,” he said
admiringly. “How deep have you gone?”</p>

<p>“About seventy-eight feet.”</p>

<p>“And the end not in sight!”</p>

<p>“Not yet, but of course it’s only a chamber.”</p>

<p>“You’ve taken out close on half a million here alone.”</p>

<p>“Pretty near. What the devil made you suppose I’d
take a paltry hundred thousand for the hill?”</p>

<p>“Oh, just to avoid trouble. You have the reputation
of being a very clever man.”</p>

<p>“Thanks. It’s cold standing round. Wouldn’t you like
to take a walk? How’d you like to see the Primo Mine?”</p>

<p>As Gregory, who was watching him intently, anticipated,
the man’s face lit up. “I should like it!” he said definitely.
“I hear that they too have struck chalcopyrite.
Lost their gold vein.”</p>

<p>“They’re nosing after it in another direction. When
the lease is up I shall consolidate with the Blakes.”</p>

<p>“Quite natural. Of course it’s the same vein?—the
chalcopyrite, I mean.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[152]</span>“Unquestionably. And it apexes in my property.”</p>

<p>“Are you so sure of that?”</p>

<p>“Not a doubt in the world. I struck the top of the
vein twelve feet below the surface. But it will never go
to the courts.”</p>

<p>“Of course not.”</p>

<p>Gregory, who looked remote, almost blank, lost not an
intonation of the other man’s voice, nor a flickering gleam
in his cunning eyes. His own head was a little on one side,
which, had Mr. Robinson had the good fortune to know
him better, would have warned him that the young man
for whom he had conceived a certain respect was thinking
hard and to some purpose.</p>

<p>Douglas, who had a personal liking for his neighbor,
unaware that he had been the chief instrument in the upsetting
of skillful plans for untold wealth, readily gave
permission to visit the mine as soon as the smoke from a
recent blast would permit. Gregory and Mr. Robinson
walked about to keep warm, the former pointing out the
probability of a faulted ore vein under the aspens, and
enlarging upon the great fortune bound to be Mrs. Blake’s
in any case. Then as the man merely remarked, “Yes,
charming woman, Mrs. Blake; thought the night of the
Prom she was one of the prettiest women I ever saw. No
dead easy game there”; Gregory refrained from kicking
him and said innocently.</p>

<p>“Good thing the law compels creditors to present their
claims within a limited time, or Amalgamated might grab
this mine and bore through to my hill. I understand Judge
Stratton was heavily in debt to the Anaconda Company
when he died.”</p>

<p>Mr. Robinson’s face turned a deep brick-red, and he
shot a piercing glance into the narrow noncommittal eyes
opposite.</p>

<p>“Of course—it’s too late for that, but—Oh, well——”
He broke off abruptly and walked toward the shaft as Osborne
beckoned. Gregory stood a moment, his head bent
forward. He had experienced the sensation of coming
into contact with an electrical wave. But he was smiling
pleasantly as he joined his guest at the shaft house.</p>

<p>After the visit to the mine, during which he amiably
pointed out the dip of the vein toward his own property,
and Mr. Robinson succumbed to the charm which never<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[153]</span>
missed fire when Gregory chose to exert it, they walked
back to the ranch, where a team awaited the ambassador at
the foot of the hill.</p>

<p>“I’ve had quite a delightful visit,” began Mr. Robinson,
when Gregory interrupted:</p>

<p>“I’ve no intention of letting you go. You must have
supper at the farm and meet Oakley. I’ll send off the
rig and drive you in myself——”</p>

<p>“Oh, I couldn’t think of troubling you——” Robinson,
red again, stood in almost agitated embarrassment.</p>

<p>“No train to Butte till nine-thirty. You don’t want
to spend four hours in Pony?”</p>

<p>“The fact is——” But whatever he had on his mind
died on his lips. He looked sharply into the bland smiling
eyes opposite, and concluded abruptly, “All right. Many
thanks. Glad of the chance to know you better.”</p>

<p>He paid off the driver of the team and they walked
toward the ranch house, Gregory commenting on Oakley’s
genius for dry farming, and expatiating upon the excellence
of the crops. Mining was not mentioned again during the
evening and the lawyer enjoyed an excellent supper.</p>

<p>Gregory drove him to Pony, and clung to him so closely
that he had no opportunity to visit the telegraph office or
a telephone booth. They shook hands cordially as the
train moved off. When it was out of sight Gregory sent
a telegram to Mark telling him to take the first train next
morning for Virginia City and meet him in the Court
House. He took his car to a garage and spent the night
in Pony. On the following morning at nine o’clock he
walked into the Tax Collector’s office at the County Seat.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">THE County Treasurer, who had just come in, looked
blank for a moment, then greeted his visitor with
effusive cordiality.</p>

<p>“Always glad to see you, Mr. Compton. It does a poor
clerk’s heart good just to look at a man who’s such a
favourite of fortune. Sit down, sir.”</p>

<p>“I will. I’ve a good deal to say.”</p>

<p>“Staked off the rest of your ranch? It’ll be some little
time yet before you get those patents through you’ve
applied for already——”</p>

<p>“What do the taxes foot up on the Oro Fino Primo
Mine?”</p>

<p>“Ah—What?” The man’s face turned scarlet, then
white. He was a young man, clerically able, but otherwise
insignificant. “Why——” Then he became voluble.</p>

<p>“The Primo mine, over there near your place? It’s a new
claim, isn’t it? Never heard of it before those fellows
from New York sank a shaft and struck it rich. Why
should there be any taxes before the regular——”</p>

<p>“You know as well as I do that Judge Stratton patented
that mine and did the necessary amount of development
work, then found it salted and abandoned it. That
was twenty-eight years ago. He forgot it, and so, apparently,
did this office. It was regarded as an abandoned
prospect hole, if anyone thought about it at all. I haven’t
discussed the matter with Mr. Blake, but assume that he’s
merely been waiting for his bill. Now, for reasons of my
own, I’ve telegraphed him to meet me here this morning,
but in case he can’t come I’m prepared to pay the amount
myself. How much?” and he took out his checque book.</p>

<p>The treasurer looked as if the cane seat of his chair
had turned to hot coals. “Really—that is a large order,
Mr. Compton. Twenty-eight years. It will take time to go
over the records.”</p>

<p>“I’m prepared to wait all day if necessary.”</p>

<p>“But why this haste?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[155]</span>“I have my reasons. They don’t concern you in the
least. Do they?”</p>

<p>“Why—no—but I am very busy——”</p>

<p>“Then put someone else on the job. I assume that the
county is not averse to raking in a tidy little sum in a
hurry.”</p>

<p>“Really——”</p>

<p>Gregory leaned back in his chair and smiled pleasantly.</p>

<p>“You had a telephone from Mr. John Robinson this
morning.”</p>

<p>This time the man started visibly, but he made an effort
to control himself. “I have just come in——”</p>

<p>“He telephoned to you last night, did he not? What
did he offer you to permit him to pay those taxes today?”</p>

<p>“I will not be insulted, sir.” The man’s voice was almost
a scream. He heartily wished he had been in training
a few years longer, a graduate of the famous Heinze-Amalgamated
orgy of corruption, or of the Clark-Daly
epoch, when nearly every man in office had been bribed
or hoped to be. “I never heard of Mr. Robinson!”</p>

<p>“Of course he reminded you that as the taxes are long
delinquent the county has the right to put the property
up at public auction, and that in any case Mrs. Blake
would hardly be given the usual year in which to redeem
it. But why auction when the money is ready to be paid
over at once? How much did he offer you?”</p>

<p>“I repeat——”</p>

<p>“I think I can guess. It was five thousand dollars.
I’ll make it ten. Get to work.”</p>

<p>The man, in whom excitement had destroyed his appetite
for breakfast, and who had started out in life with
the usual negative ideals of honesty, burst into tears. “My
God!” he sobbed. “I’ve heard of the third degree. Your
eyes bore a hole through one. They hurt, I say. To think
that you should come in here and accuse me of taking
bribes.”</p>

<p>“Oh, hell, cut it out. Montana may be a great state,
but she has her rotten spot like any other. She’s been so
debauched the last twenty years by open bribery that I
doubt if you could lay your hand on a hundred men in
her that haven’t had a roll anywhere from five hundred
to twenty thousand dollars passed to them, and pocketed
it. Estimable citizens, too, but a man never knows his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[156]</span>
weak spot until he has a wad of easy money thrust under
his nose—or flung over his transom. You are no worse
than the rest. Do you take my offer?”</p>

<p>The County Treasurer recovered himself with amazing
alacrity. Ten thousand dollars in a lump never had
haunted his wildest dreams.</p>

<p>“All right, sir. It’s a bargain. But I want bills. No
checks for me.”</p>

<p>“I congratulate you on your foresight! But there have
been times in this state when checque books were not
opened for months. You shall have it in bills. Where are
the records?”</p>

<p>“In the vault there.”</p>

<p>“I’ll sit here. If you attempt to leave the room to
go to a telephone I’ll drag you out on the Court House
steps and tell the story to the town. Now get to work.”</p>

<p>“I’ll keep my word, sir, and I know you’ll keep yours.”
He went into the vault and appeared later trundling out
a pile of records, then sat down at a table and concentrated
his mind as earnestly as if corruption had never blighted
it. Gregory watched him until Mark entered. Then the
two men went out into the corridor, standing where they
could see the table. Gregory recounted his interview with
Mr. John Robinson, and the present sequel.</p>

<p>Mark listened with his mouth open, an expression of profound
chagrin loosening the muscles of his cheerful
healthy shrewd face.</p>

<p>“By George!” he cried. “And to think that was the
one thing I never thought of. Of course I knew about
the delinquent taxes, and intended to pay them when I was
good and ready; but what’s the use of forking over till
you have to? But not to have thought of this! And I
pride myself upon sleeping with one eye open—never was
caught napping yet!” And for five minutes he exploited
his vocabulary of profanity, heaping each epithet upon his
own humiliated head.</p>

<p>Gregory laughed. “Merely another proof that two
heads are better than one. Do you stand for the ten
thousand? If not I’ll pay half.”</p>

<p>“I’d pay fifty——”</p>

<p>“I’ll pay half,” said Gregory definitely. “It means as
much to me as to you.”</p>

<p>“All right. Jimminy, but they’re clever!” He was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[157]</span>
calmer and his astute legal brain was moved to admiration.
“But you are cleverer. I’ve always sworn by you. They’ll
get a jolt all right. How did you catch on, anyhow?”</p>

<p>“I fancy I got a wireless. The other man was thinking
hard and so was I—had practically nothing else in our
minds. Those things will be better explained some day.
Perhaps it was merely a good guess.”</p>

<p>“You hit the nail on the head all right. I’ll have a letter
to write to Ora next Sunday! She’s had a narrow
squeak, and she shall know whom to thank for it.”</p>

<p>“Oh, cut that out.”</p>

<p>Gregory went to the bank and drew the ten thousand
dollars, while Mark kept watch. When the bill was finally
made out, Mark examined it critically, and then gave his
personal checque. Three months later the County Treasurer
resigned his office on the ground of ill health and
bought an orange grove in Southern California. There
he and his growing family enjoy a respected, prosperous,
bucolic life.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">GREGORY had scored against the most powerful combination
of capital in the world. He knew that they
knew he had scored, for he had met Mr. John Robinson as
he descended the Court House steps with the husband of
the delinquent taxpayer, and he felt reasonably elated.
But the keenest and canniest brains are not infallible, and
he underestimated the resources of his mighty and now
open enemy. Three mornings later, while he was still
asleep, Joshua Mann, the miner in his confidence and devoted
to his interests, burst into the cabin and shook
him.</p>

<p>“There’s the devil to pay, sir,” he cried. “Amalgamated
has staked off a claim between our boundary line
and Primo.”</p>

<p>Gregory sat up in bed. He never awakened dazed, but
with every faculty alert. “What are you talking about?
The Primo claim almost overlaps the ranch.”</p>

<p>“So anyone would think. But it doesn’t. That’s the
point. Of course the old stakes of the Primo rotted long
ago. They must have got hold of the original map. But
there it is: a bit of unclaimed land between Primo and
the ranch. There isn’t much more than room to sink a
shaft, but there is, all right. Guess they’ve got us on the
hip.” And having delivered his news he relieved his mind
with profanity, of which he too had a choice assortment.</p>

<p>Gregory flung on his clothes and accompanied by Mann
walked hastily to the edge of the hill. There, sure enough,
were the four posts and the flaunting notice of a located
claim.</p>

<p>“Must have done it between shifts last night,” commented
the miner. “Didn’t take long and the moon
helped. By jing!—if I’d been round with a shotgun!
Well, there’ll be fun underground sames on top. The moment
they break through we’ll be ready for ’em. They
may get there but they won’t stay long. The boys will<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[159]</span>
like the fun; and we’d put our last cent on you—know a
winner when we see one.”</p>

<p>“Put on an extra force and make them work like hell.
<i>We must get here first.</i> When I’m not below you’re boss.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, sir. I’ll keep ’em on the job, all right.”</p>

<p>“Promise them extra pay. Come up to me at eight
o’clock tonight and we’ll talk it over.”</p>

<p>He went back to the cabin and telephoned to Mark to
come out at once. The lawyer arrived in the course of
the morning. The first ten minutes of the interview may
be passed over. Then Mark recovered his equilibrium. He
lit a cigar, demanded a drink, and elevated his feet to
the table.</p>

<p>“We’ll just thresh this question out, turn the spot-light
on every side of it, present and future. We ought to have
done it before, but that first victory was a little too
heady. Nothing like a defeat to clear the brain. What’s
the first thing they’ll do? They won’t waste time sinking
a shaft if they can help it. That’s the hardest kind of
country rock. They’ll try to buy up the lease from
Douglas and Osborne. I haven’t the lease with me, but
most leases carry a clause which permits the original
lessees to sub-let. I fancy I could get out an injunction
and delay them, however, until the lease expired. But
what they can do, all right, is to bribe those two men to
give them the use of their cross-cut—the one that has
already struck your vein—while they were sinking the
shaft. Do you think they’ll fall for it?”</p>

<p>“My experience is that most men can be bribed if the
roll is big enough. Osborne and Douglas are pretty discouraged,
although they’ve begun to drift across the fault.
I’ll talk to them, but they’re not square men. Amalgamated
could pretend to be sinking a shaft against time itself,
and be drifting for all they were worth on the Primo vein.
I understand that Amalgamated’s head geologist has been
nosing round for some time and has concluded there’s a
parallel fissure in their claim and that they can ‘prove’
apex rights.”</p>

<p>“How deep do you figure they’d have to sink to strike
the vein at that point?”</p>

<p>“About two hundred feet, owing to that surface bump.”</p>

<p>“And it apexes here. There’s no getting round that—with
a square deal. But they figure on proving that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[160]</span>
they’ve the main vein, and yours is an offshoot? The case
would go to Helena—to the Federal Courts—as Amalgamated
was incorporated out of the state. That’s bad. If
the case could be tried in Virginia City, and there was a
good healthy suspicion that the Judge was expecting to
retire in comfort, you could apply for a change of
venue—result of that odorous chapter in our history when
every judge was on the pay roll of either Heinze or
Amalgamated. Well, at least there’s public opinion to
be considered; the state is waking up. Here is one thing
we can do. If it comes to a knock-out fight and the case
goes to Helena, we can get out an expert geologist of
national reputation, whose record shows him to be above
bribes, and who will be bound to testify that the vein
apexes in your claim. Becke of the School of Mines, will
find the man we want. Now, what’s your first move?”</p>

<p>“To stope the vein as far as the boundary line, which
of course is my side-line, and as far down as possible. If
they won in the courts I’d have to fork over eventually,
but they’d have to wait for it, and they’ll get a good jolt
underground.”</p>

<p>“You’re much too calm. What have you got up your
sleeve?”</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you that when the time comes. It has nothing
to do with the present case. The best thing you can do
now is to make the whole thing public and get public
opinion behind us. They don’t own all the newspapers in
the state, and they don’t own all the newspapers in the
rest of the country, either. Are you on?”</p>

<p>“You bet. Aren’t you afraid there’ll be a sudden strike
among your miners? After all, Amalgamated is popular
among the mining class. They pay good wages and treat
the men pretty squarely all round. I’ll say that much for
them.”</p>

<p>“I’m not worrying about that. I’ll raise the wages of
my miners, and they like me. I call every one of them by
his first name, and they’re men—not a Bohunk among
them—and like the idea, too, of a fight under a good captain.
If I’d put an Eastern manager in who’d put on
dog, it might be different, but I’ve worked shoulder to
shoulder with them, and not one of them has stuck harder
to his job. Besides, Mann is devoted to me, and has great
influence over them.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[161]</span>“Well, Amalgamated can’t queer you in the East, for
you get your roll from the Smelting Works. If that went
back on you——”</p>

<p>“I’m not worrying about that, either. Torrence is a
friend of mine. He’s also a Mason. If things get hot he’ll
give headquarters a hint that my men, their blood being
up, are as likely as not to make a bonfire somewhere. Get
back to town and give the story to the new evening paper.
Its lay is to fight Amalgamated for the sake of notoriety.
See that their brightest man writes a story for one of the
biggest New York and Chicago newspapers. Now, clear out.
I’ve got to go below.”</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THE next day Gregory visited a mine in Lewis and Clark
County which recently had shut down, and bought
a compressor at second hand. His miners with the air
drills were soon working at five times the rate of speed that
had been possible with the hand drills. The contractor in
charge of the development work on what was impudently
known as the Apex Mine, had installed a gasoline hoist,
every new device, and as large a force as it was possible at
that early stage to employ with profit. Gregory interviewed
Osborne and Douglas, and obtained profuse assurances,
but Mann soon discovered that there was an increased
force on the Primo copper vein. Their original
lease was nearly up but they had accepted Mark’s offer of
two months’ grace; an offer he deeply regretted now, but
the papers were signed and sealed. They made a feint of
pushing the drift across the fault, but as they employed
a small force at that point there was little room for doubt
that they had been amply compensated for a doubtful
undertaking.</p>

<p>Meanwhile work on the great surface chamber of Perch
of the Devil Mine was drawing to a close. It had proved
to be a hundred feet long, thirty feet wide, and seventy feet
deep, and had netted half a million dollars. Some time
since one of the larger houses on the West Side in Butte,
built by a millionaire while still faithful to Montana, but
whose family now spent twelve months of the year in
Europe, New York, or California, had been thrown on the
market for less than a third of its cost; new millionaires
are not as plentiful in Amalgamated Butte as of old, and
that unique camp is still a perch, even for those that make
moderate fortunes; if no longer for the devil. It never
will be a favourite roost for the gamecock’s hens and
chicks. The hotels and “blocks” are always overcrowded,
and even bungalows are in demand by the energetic but
impermanent young engineers and managers of the various<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[163]</span>
companies; but “palatial residences,” built by enthusiastic
citizens who either died promptly or retired in favour of
their families, are a drug on that great market they
helped to build. When the Murphy house, therefore, was
advertised for sale Gregory bought it for Ida and cabled
her the news together with five thousand dollars Mark had
recently made for him on the stock-market.</p>

<p>Above these and other expenditures, he now had half a
million dollars to his credit, but he wanted a million
more. The new vein was very rich for chalcopyrite, but
its depth was problematical, and it might drop in values at
any moment. If his belief in his hill was justified and
there were huge primary deposits below, there would be
no end to his riches; but it would take a year or more to
determine that point; and meanwhile he wanted at least
a million and a half, not only to meet the possible expenses
of litigation, but to mine at depth and to open up his other
claims in case Amalgamated, when it reached the chalcopyrite
vein, claimed that it apexed in their property,
got out an injunction, and forced him to cease work
on it.</p>

<p>But he had another and to him a still more vital reason
for wishing to make a great sum of money. Half a million
dollars, particularly when spectacularly acquired, alters
a man’s position in his community at once, and the readjustment
of his own mental attitude toward life follows as
a matter of course; particularly in a country where money
not only talks but rules. He was now treated, when business
took him to any of the towns, as a permanent capitalist
of the great state of Montana; moreover, his romantic
attitude toward his hill having been inevitably dampened
by its yield of mere copper, his appreciation of its heavy
contribution to his bank account was wholly practical.
He not only began to forecast himself as one of the small
group of front-rank millionaires which Montana has donated
to the American Brotherhood of Millionaires, but
to be sensible of the sudden and active growth of those
business instincts he had always known were dormant
in his brain. It had needed but the rousing of his fighting
instinct, the success of its first move, and the swift countermove
of the enemy, to awaken the permanent desire, not
alone to pit his brains against Amalgamated, but to show
the world what he could do. In short he was on his mettle,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[164]</span>
and conscious for the first time of his powers and ultimate
ambitions.</p>

<p>He had found his mine by an accident. Nature had
flung it into his lap. He was now determined to prove that
he could make money with the resources of his brain as
rapidly as the more famous of the Montanans had made it
in the past, when opportunities were supposed to be more
numerous. There never was a time when opportunity did
not coincide with the man, and of this Gregory was contemptuously
aware when he dismissed the usual Wall
Street resource as commonplace, beneath the consideration
of a man living in a state whose resources had barely been
tapped.</p>

<p>When live brains of peculiar gifts think hard and uninterruptedly
on a given subject they become magnets. Gregory
paid frequent visits to Butte and Helena, talking
casually with many men. In less than a fortnight he found
his cue, and, accompanied by a civil engineer, disappeared
for a week.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">XXVIII</h3>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">TWENTY years ago it was the ambition of every Californian,
no matter how blatant his state pride, to
move to New York. Today he hopes to live and die in
California, the main reason being that the women of his
family find themselves members of a comparatively old and
settled community, enjoying many advantages and no little
importance; given frequent trips abroad they are content
to remain at home in houses of modern architecture,
and to command a social position that New York has
granted to only two or three of California’s heiresses and
millionaires. Montanans, at present, those that are rich or
merely independent, are in the migratory phase of the
earlier Californian; but as New York has extended to
them an even more grudging welcome than it did to aspirants
from the more picturesque state, they visit it,
after successive social disappointments, merely for its
dressmakers and those exterior advantages that may be
exchanged for gold; the majority migrate to “The Coast,”
more particularly to Southern California. There they not
only find relief on the sea-level from an altitude that plays
havoc with the nerves, but, in the mushroom Southern
cities, social position may be had for the asking, and every
advantage for growing children.</p>

<p>Gregory had heard of a man named Griffiths, owner of
the Circle-G Ranch, a tract of land covering seventy-five
thousand acres, who was anxious to sell and move to
Los Angeles. As the ranch was practically waterless and
thirty miles from a railroad, his only chance of disposing
of it was by means of an alluring bargain. He was willing
to sell the ranch, his large herds of horses and cattle,
and bands of sheep for half a million dollars.</p>

<p>Gregory returned to Butte without the engineer, went
directly to Blake’s office, and laid his programme before his
astounded friend and legal adviser.</p>

<p>He had found Griffiths a man unaccustomed to business<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[166]</span>
but with his mind set upon retiring with a capital of
half a million dollars. His efforts in money-making
hitherto, had been confined to acquiring rather than
disposing of property, and his trading consisted of converting
live stock into such cash as was necessary for the
purchase of necessities not raised on his property. But
he was nearly sixty, his wife and four daughters had besought
him for years to sell out and take them to California,
and he was now persuaded that he was as tired of
life in the wilds of Montana as they were. He was, however,
possessed of one fixed idea, to leave each of his
“women folks” a hundred thousand dollars when he
died. Therefore would he not take a cent less than five
times that amount for his fine property; but although he
inserted the advertisement that had caught Gregory’s eye,
so far he had been unsuccessful. One man found the ranch
too far from a railroad, another no good for farming, save
intensive, as it was without a water supply; still another
was willing to pay only a third of the amount down, with
easy terms for the remainder.</p>

<p>“It’s five hundred thousand cold cash,” said Mr. Griffiths
to Gregory; although in a burst of confidence later he
had said: “What the dickens I’m goin’ to do with that
great wad of money when I get it beats me! It turns me
cold to think of it.”</p>

<p>Gregory had remained on the ranch two days, inventorying
its stock, buildings, and natural resources. He estimated
that seventy-five per cent. of the property was plow-land,
the rest “rough, wooded, and rolling.” There were
several sets of buildings on it, and the cattle and sheep
sheds were in good condition. The cattle, sheep, and horses
could be sold on a rising market for $200,000, thus reducing
the cost of the land to four dollars an acre. After asking
and receiving an option for thirty days, Gregory intimated
that he would like to extend his trip into the mountains
in search of float, and hired two riding horses and
a pack horse from his host, besides buying of him the
necessary food supply. Incidentally, in the course of
conversation he learned that there was a river “somewheres
in the mountains between thirty and forty miles
northeast.”</p>

<p>He received more minute directions from a prospector
regarding this body of water, which was the object of his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[167]</span>
trip, and six miles from Circle-G entered a ravine some
twenty-five miles long. After climbing one of the mountain
sides that bounded the ravine, descending and crossing
another gulch, and climbing again, he and his companion
saw, far below, between the narrow walls of a
cañon, an abundant mountain stream.</p>

<p>The engineer proposed to divert this body of water to
Circle-G Ranch. Through the nearest mountain side he
should drive a tunnel six hundred feet long, and cross
the short and crooked ravine with a thousand feet of flume
to a point where it would be necessary to drive another
tunnel, about two hundred feet in length. This would conduct
the diverted body of water into the long ravine, down
which it would flow to a point six miles above the ranch.
Here the engineer purposed to construct a dam thirty
feet high for the purpose of raising the water to an elevation
from which it would flow through a canal or “ditch”,
to the more level portions of the ranch. A rough estimate
of the cost of this project, from headworks to ditch was
$300,000.</p>

<p>He returned to Circle-G, told Mr. Griffiths that he had
found no float, but nevertheless liked the neighbourhood
and was inclined to buy the ranch and sell it in small
farms to settlers. He would return to Butte and think
it over. If he concluded to buy he would pay a half million
dollars in cash, and, if Mr. Griffiths were agreeable
borrow back $300,000, for improvements, giving a mortgage
at seven per cent. on the forty thousand acres he proposed
to make attractive for settlers. He gave no hint of his
irrigation project. Griffiths had known of this body of
water, but it had never occurred to him nor to anyone else
to divert it. He was a stock-grower, pure and simple, with
no “modern notions”, and Gregory had no intention of
enlarging his vision. He would pay the man his price, but
he had the ruthlessness of his type.</p>

<p>He had more than one motive for offering to borrow
back $300,000 of the payment money; not only should he
need it at once, but he feared, after Mr. Griffiths’ confidence,
and knowing his kind, that the old man would withdraw
in terror at the last moment, preferring the safe
monotonies of his ranch to the unknown responsibilities of
a capitalist; like others he had heard that it is sometimes
easier to get money than to invest it. Gregory told him<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[168]</span>
to think it over and write to the Daly and Clark Banks in
Butte, and to the National Bank of Montana, in Helena, for
information regarding his own standing and financial condition.
He left the entire family in as hopeful a frame of
mind as himself.</p>

<p>On confirmation of the report that forty thousand acres
could be put under water by gravity, he should close the
deal at once, file a notice of appropriation for forty
thousand miner’s inches of water, and begin work on the
first tunnel. He then intended to lay the matter before
one of the great land selling organisations of Chicago or
New York, proposing that he be paid $1,400,000 for the
forty thousand acres of irrigated land, subject to mortgage;
demonstrating that the land so purchased for thirty-five
dollars an acre (or forty-three and a half dollars including
the mortgage) could readily be sold to settlers
for one hundred, if railroad facilities were provided. As
a further inducement, to cover the cost of railroad construction,
he would execute a deed and place it in escrow,
as a guarantee and evidence of good faith, and accompanied
by a contract authorising the land selling company
to dispose of the remaining thirty-five thousand acres at
ten dollars an acre. The construction of the railroad would
add materially to the value of the unirrigated land also,
and a pledge of this portion of the property as security
that the railroad would be built would be acceptable, because
the estimated cost, with liberal allowances, was
under $350,000.</p>

<p>The sum paid him by the land selling company would,
in addition to the large sum realised by the sale of the live
stock, give him at least $1,600,000, or $1,100,000 over the
half million originally invested.</p>

<p>Mark listened with his eyes and mouth wide open.</p>

<p>“By George!” he exclaimed, when Gregory finished.
“Did you dope all that out yourself? That’s the talk of
a man who’s been in the land business for years. How did
you ever think of it?”</p>

<p>“What’s a man’s brain given to him for—to turn round
in a circle? Do you find the plan feasible?”</p>

<p>“It’s feasible all right—given a cold half million in
hand and brains behind it—plus imagination. That’s where
you win out. You’ll be the richest man in Montana yet.”</p>

<p>“I intend to be.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[169]</span>“And the first man born here to make one of the old-time
fortunes.”</p>

<p>“I hadn’t thought of that!”</p>

<p>Mark dismissed enthusiasm and put his own astute brain
to work.</p>

<p>“The hitch will be with your land selling company.
They might be dazzled, even convinced, but they’re cold-blooded,
and they never have any too much cash on hand.
What special line of argument do you propose to hand
out?”</p>

<p>“Several. I didn’t go to the Circle-G Ranch without
making certain investigations beforehand. In the first
place Government statistics prove the productivity of Montana
soil without irrigation. I am not the first to discover
that this same soil when irrigated is insured against crop
failure. In the second place a study of the U. S. Government
reclamation projects convinced me that I could, all
things being favourable (such as water supply and gravity),
put a large tract of land under water at a very small
cost compared to the cost under the plan of procedure
adopted by the Government. By the plan I have mapped
out I can sell both land and water for less than the cost of
water alone under the Government direction. But I have a
final inducement which I believe will bring the selling
company to terms. Those forty thousand acres when irrigated
will be peculiarly adapted to the growing of seed
peas. This is the best soil in the country for peas. Now
the seed houses of the country are in great need of large
quantities of seed peas, and the selling company could
easily interest these concerns to the extent of securing their
financial backing. They would no doubt buy large blocks
themselves. Such an opportunity has never been offered
them—forty thousand acres under the ditch, and adequate
railroad service. This will enable the selling company to
raise an initial payment to me of $200,000. And if I
guarantee the ditch and the railroad they are in a position
to make the same guarantee to settlers to whom they may
make sales in a retail way. They’ll have no difficulty getting
$100 an acre retail; and the seed houses no doubt
would invest and become real owners, thus saving the profit
now paid to farmers who grow for them under contract.
Got it?”</p>

<p>“I get you. But why put all of your own money into<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[170]</span>
the ranch? Ora has taken something like half a million
out of that mine. I could let you have that.”</p>

<p>“I’ll risk no woman’s money. Of course I shouldn’t
put my own in if I didn’t believe it to be a dead sure
thing, but there’s always risk.” He took a packet of
papers from his overcoat pocket. “Here are the option
and abstract of titles. I wish you would examine them.
Say nothing of all this at present—nor for a long time
after. I’ll spring it when I’m ready—which will be after
I’ve disposed of the irrigated land. Will you go out with
me when I return to Circle-G? I shall want you to attend
to the details of sale and to the location of the water
rights.”</p>

<p>“I’ll go all right. And I’m only living to see what
you’ll do next.”</p>

<p class="drop-cap">MEANWHILE the story of the Compton-Amalgamated
war was the sensation not only of Montana but of the
entire country. The Butte morning papers ignored it, but
the <i>Evening Bugle</i> reaped a golden harvest. The editor
himself, who was the Montana correspondent of one of the
great New York dailies, made his reputation with the most
sensational “stuff” that had gone from the Northwest
since Heinze retired from the field. The hill swarmed with
reporters. Two Eastern newspapers sent special correspondents
to the spot. In less than a fortnight the public
knew all there was to know and far more. Perch of the
Devil Mine was photographed inside and out, and its uncompromising
ugliness but added to its magnetism; which
emanated from a “solid hill of metal just below a thin
layer of barren soil.” The general reader, who admired
the colour of copper, conceived that it emerged in solid
sheets.</p>

<p>Gregory refused to be interviewed or photographed, but
was snapshotted; and his long sinewy figure and lean dark
face, his narrow eyes and fine mouth, won the championship
of every woman partial to the type. The women’s papers,
as well as those run by radicals, socialists, and conservative
men of independent tendencies, advocated his cause against
the wicked trust; nor was there a newspaper in the country,
however capitalised, that resisted the temptation to
make him “big news.” To his unspeakable annoyance he
began to receive letters by the score, most of them from
women; but he lost no time employing a secretary whose
duty was to read and burn them. He appreciated his fame
very vaguely, for between his mine and the innumerable
details connected with his new ranch, he had little time
to devote to newspapers or his own sensations. But although
personal notoriety was distasteful to him and
reporters a nuisance, he felt more than compensated by
the success of his publicity scheme, and the assurance that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[172]</span>
it was causing the enemy unspeakable annoyance and apprehension.</p>

<p>He paid a visit to Chicago after work had begun on
the first tunnel, and spent several days with the interested
but cautious officials of the greatest of the land selling companies.
Like all silent men, when he did talk it was not
only to the point, but he used carefully composed arguments
incisively expressed. He indulged in no rhetorical
flights, no enthusiasms, no embellishment of plain facts.
He might have been a mathematician working out an abstract
problem in algebra; and this attitude, combined with
his reputation as a “winner”, and the details of his
cautious purchase of Circle-G Ranch, finally impressed the
company to the extent of sending one of their number,
who was an expert in land values, to the ranch. Gregory
accompanied him, took him to the mountain river, showed
him the engineer’s report, pointed out the undeviating
slope between the river and the ranch, and the land’s rich
chocolate brown soil of unlimited depth. The upshot was
that the expert returned to Chicago almost as enthusiastic
as if the original scheme were his. After consultation
with several of the seed houses, the land company agreed
to buy on Compton’s terms, and to pay $200,000 down,
$500,000 at the end of sixty days, and $700,000 at the end
of four months.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Ora and Ida had asked for an extension of leave, as
they had not yet “done” Italy, Spain, and Egypt, and
both husbands had given a willing consent; Gregory from
sheer indifference; Mark because he was so busy that he
no longer had time to miss his wife. He refused to give
Ora’s picture to the enterprising correspondents, but they
found no difficulty with the local photographer. They had
not been long uncovering the romantic history of the Oro
Fino Primo Mine, and it made a welcome pendant to the
still recourseful “story” of Perch of the Devil. Ora’s
beauty, accomplishments, charm, family history, as well
as her present social progress in company with her “equally
beautiful friend”, the wife of the hero of the hour, became
public property.</p>

<p>Altogether, Butte, after several years of oblivion, was
happy and excited. So far, although mineralogically the
most sensational state in the Union, and the third in size,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[173]</span>
she had given to the world but four highly specialized individuals:
Marcus Daly, perhaps the greatest mine manager
and ore wizard of our time; W. A. Clark, who accumulated
millions as a moving picture show rolls in dimes; F.
Augustus Heinze, who should be the greatest financial
power in America if brains were all; and the Sapphic,
coruscatic, imperishable Mary McLane. An outstanding
quartette. But Daly was dead, Clark was but one of many
millionaires, submerged in New York, Heinze was reaping
the whirlwind, and the poet was nursing her wounds.
Montana was in the mood for a new hero, and the American
press for a new and picturesque subject to “play up for
all he was worth.”</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">XXX</h3>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">ORA and Ida were sitting at one of the little round
tables in the pretty green and wicker smoking-room of
the Hotel Bristol in Genoa, drinking their coffee and smoking
their after-luncheon cigarettes, when Ida, who was
glancing over the <i>Herald</i>, cried,</p>

<p>“Aw!”</p>

<p>Ora looked round in surprise. Ida often relieved the
strain when they were alone by relapsing into the vernacular,
but was impressively elegant in public.</p>

<p>“What is it?” she asked apprehensively. “Anybody
we know dead? That is about all the news we ever get
in these Continental——”</p>

<p>“Dead nothing. Greg’s struck a bigger bonanza than
I had any idea of, and Amalgamated is after it. They
tried to corral your mine for delinquent taxes, but got
left. Found a bit of unclaimed land between your claim
and the ranch and staked off. They’re sinking a shaft and
mean to prove that the vein—Greg’s—apexes in their
claim. Wouldn’t that come and get you! Just listen.”
And she read aloud an embellished but not untruthful tale.
“Glory, I hope they don’t get him! That would be the
end of all my fond dreams.”</p>

<p>“I have an idea that Mr. Compton was born to win.
At all events you have your new house in Butte, and all
the money you can spend for the present.”</p>

<p>“Yes, but I want money to spend in Butte, live in that
house, and make things hum. However, I guess you’re
right. I’ll bet on Greg. Here come the letters. Hope
you get one from Mark as I’d like some real news.”</p>

<p>A page with letters in his hand had entered the room.
He served the young American ladies first as their tips
were frequent and munificent, particularly Ora’s. The
other people in the room were English and Italian.</p>

<p>Ida’s letters were from Ruby and Pearl. Ora’s from
Mark, Professor Becke, and two of her English friends.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[175]</span>
She opened her husband’s first. It contained an account
of the threatened loss of her mine, her narrow escape, and
Gregory’s rescue. It was graphically written. Mark
fancied himself as a letter writer and never was averse
from impressing his clever wife.</p>

<p>Ora’s face flushed as she read; she lost her breath once
or twice. She pictured every expression of Gregory’s
eyes as he perforated the clerk; her heart hammered its
admiration. She was too thoroughly Montanan and the
daughter of her father to be horrified at bribery and corruption.
For the moment she forgot gratitude in her
exultation that he had triumphed over the mightiest trust
in the country. But before she finished the letter she
sighed and set her lips. She handed it deliberately to
Ida.</p>

<p>“Here is an account of the first development,” she said
casually. “It will interest you.”</p>

<p>Ida read the letter hastily. “Well, they caught him
napping after all,” she said with profound dissatisfaction.
“He dreams too much, that’s what. He’s got a practical
side all right, but he isn’t on the job all the time. I’d
like to write and tell him what I think of him but guess I’d
better keep my mouth shut.”</p>

<p>“It was Mark’s fault as much as Mr. Compton’s—more.
He should have had a new map made of my claim; or, if
he did have one made, he should have studied it more carefully.
Anybody to look at it would assume that it touched
the boundary line of your—Mr. Compton’s ranch.”</p>

<p>“Well, Greg’ll get out of it some way. When he does
sit up and take notice he doesn’t so much as wink, and so
far as he knew or cared the rest of the world might have
waltzed off into space. Lucky it hit him to buy the house
and send that last five thousand before he snapped close
on Amalgamated——”</p>

<p>“What does Miss Miller have to say?”</p>

<p>“Nothing much but ecstasies over my house. The
Murphys had taste, it seems, so I won’t have to do a thing
to it. Say, Ora, don’t you feel as if you’d like to go
back?”</p>

<p>Ora looked up and her face turned white. “Go back?
I thought you wanted to stay over here for a year, at least.
We haven’t half seen Europe yet—to say nothing of
Egypt.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[176]</span>“Yes—I know—but sometimes I feel homesick. It isn’t
only that I want to make Butte sit up; but—well, I suppose
you’ll laugh, but I miss the mountains. I never
thought much about them when I was there, but they’ve
kind of haunted me lately.”</p>

<p>“There are mountains in Europe.”</p>

<p>“I know, but they’re just scenery. Our mountains are
different.”</p>

<p>Ora looked at her speculatively. It was not the first
time that Ida had surprised her with glow-worms flitting
across her spiritual night, although she seemed to be so
devoid of imagination, or what she would have called superfluous
nonsense, as to inspire her more highly organised
friend with envy. Her mental and artistic development
had been rapid and remarkable but uneven. She yawned
through the opera and symphony concerts. She would
always be bored by pictures unless she could read a
“story” in them, although she had now mastered the
jargon of art as well as most of her quick-witted country-women.
In Florence and Rome she had “struck” after
one morning of picture galleries, but she showed a spontaneous
and curious appreciation of the architecture of
the Renaissance. Ora had expected the usual ecstasies
over the old castles of England and Germany, but although
Ida admired them heartily, and even declared they made
her feel “real romantic,” it was for the Renaissance palaces
of France and of the cities they visited in Italy that
she reserved her instant and critical admiration. Ora,
who like most imaginative people played with the theory
of reincarnation, amused herself visioning Ida in Burne-Jones
costumes, haunting the chill midnight corridors of
a Florentine palace, dagger in hand, or brewing a poisoned
bowl. If Ida possessed a rudimentary soul, which suffered
a birth-pang now and then, Ora had caught more than one
glimpse of a savage temper combined with a cunning that
under her present advantages was rapidly developing into
subtlety. But Ida indulged too little in introspection to
develop her inmost ego other than automatically. To
mental progress she was willing to devote a certain amount
of labour. Whenever they were not on a train or visiting
at country houses, she spent an hour every morning with
a teacher of either French or Italian; German she had
refused to “tackle,” but, to use her own phrase, she “ate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[177]</span>
up” the Latin languages, and her diction was remarkably
good. If picture galleries replete with saints, virgins,
madonnas and Venuses bored her, she returned more
than once to the portrait rooms in the Pitti and the
Uffizi galleries, haunted the museums with their mediæval
and Renaissance furniture and tapestries, and eagerly
visited every palace to which the public was admitted.</p>

<p>And she proved herself as adaptable as Ora had hoped.
In England she bored her way through the newspapers
until she was able to sustain her part in political conversation.
She soon discerned that English people of assured
position and wide social experience liked a certain degree
of picturesque Americanism when it was unaccompanied
by garrulity or blatant ill-breeding. She amused herself
by “giving them what they wanted,” and was a more
pronounced success than Ora, who was outwardly too
much like themselves, yet lacking the matchless fortune of
English birth. But this did not disturb Ora, who made
more real friends, and derived endless amusement observing
Ida. On one occasion they visited for a week at one
of the country homes of a duke and duchess that had entertained
Mrs. Stratton many years ago, and Ida had enchanted
these bored but liberal products of a nation that
led with too much indifference the Grand March of Civilisation
with her Western “breeziness” and terminology
(carefully selected), combined with her severely cut and
altogether admirable gowns, and her fine imposing carriage.
From this castle she went on with Ora to one leased by
an ambitious American more English than the English,
who permitted herself to indulge in a very little fashionable
slang, but had consigned the American vernacular to
oblivion in the grave of her ancestors. Here Ida was
languid and correct (save at the midnight hour when she
sought Ora, not only for relaxation but the instructions
she was never too proud to receive); her English slang
(which she had “swapped” for much of her own with her
various British admirers) was impeccable, and she flirted
like a stage duchess.</p>

<p>She estimated the various aristocracies she entered under
Ora’s wing as a grand moving picture show run for the
benefit of Americans, and was grateful to have an inside
seat, although nothing would have bored her more than<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[178]</span>
to take a permanent position in their midst. With their
history, traditions, psychology, she concerned herself not
at all; nor did she in any way manifest a desire to cultivate
the intellectual parts of her shrewd, observing, clutching
brain. She threw away as many opportunities as she devoured,
but on the whole proved herself somewhat more
adaptable than the usual American woman elevated suddenly
from the humbler walks of life to the raking searchlights
of Society. In Berlin and Vienna she repeated her
social triumphs, for, although Americans do not penetrate
far below the crust of Continental society, smart men
abound in the crust; Ida graduated as an adept in flirtation
with agreeable and subtle men of the world, yet keeping
the most practical at arm’s length with a carefully calculated
Western directness and artlessness that amounted to
genius.</p>

<p>In France and Italy the dazzling fairness of Ora had
its innings. A vague suggestion of unreality, almost morbid,
and a very definite one of unawakened womanhood,
combined with a cultivated mind, ready wit, and air of high
breeding, gave her a success as genuine as Ida’s and somewhat
more perilous. But she soon learned to tread warily,
after her theories of European men had been vindicated by
personal experience. In fact, after the two girls had ceased
to be mere tourists they had taken the advice of one of Mrs.
Stratton’s friends and enlisted the services of an indigent
lady of title as chaperon. Lady Gower had been little
more than a figurehead but had served her purpose in
averting gossip; and now that her charges were tourists
again had returned to her lodgings in Belgravia. As maids
also are a doubtful luxury when travelling they had recently
dismissed the last of a long line.</p>

<p>On the whole the two girls had got on together amazingly
well. They had had their differences of opinion, but
Ora was too proud to quarrel, Ida too easy-going and
appreciative of the butter on her bread. It was fortunate,
however, that Gregory had been able to provide his wife
with an abundance of money, for she was far too shrewd,
and far too interested in prices, to remain hoodwinked for
long. After three months of sight-seeing and <i>pensions</i>
both had been glad to leave the tourist class and mingle in
the more spectacular life of the great world, and that had
meant trousseaux in Paris. There Ida had “gowned”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[179]</span>
herself for the first time, and her delight in her fashionable
wardrobe had been equalled only by her satisfaction
in driving a bargain. At present they were resting in
Genoa, a favourite city of Ora’s, after a hard ten weeks
in Rome.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[180]</span>

<h3 class="nobreak">XXXI</h3>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THEY finished their letters and went up to their rooms
to rest, for they had “done” several churches and
the Campo Santo during the morning.</p>

<p>“Thank the lord,” said Ida, as they walked up the
stairs after waiting ten minutes for the lift, “there are no
picture galleries in this town that one <i>must</i> see. The rest
of the programme is streets and architecture, which is
worth while. These internal streets make me feel as if I
were going right through to China, or whatever is underneath
Italy. Genoa, before it had any houses on it, must
have looked like Last Chance Gulch, Helena, Montana.”</p>

<p>They had reached their connecting rooms. Ida extended
herself on a sofa, Ora made herself as comfortable as possible
in a chair and lit a cigarette.</p>

<p>“Say, kid,” pursued Ida, “you smoke too much. Follow
my illustrious example. I go just so far and no
farther—one cigarette after each meal because it makes
me feel nice and aristocratic. You’re the kind that lets a
habit run away with you. I deliberate. You drift. See?”</p>

<p>Ora laughed. “Funny thing, nature! Anyone would
say quite the opposite of each of us.”</p>

<p>“It’s like life. Not a blooming thing is just what you
figure it out beforehand. Here I wanted the Collins house
and I’ve got the Murphy. And Greg, that I figured on
being a millionaire by the time I got back, has gone and
tied himself up in litigation, or is heading that way.”</p>

<p>“You ungrateful wretch! You came to Europe ‘figuring’
on making a thousand dollars serve for the entire trip and
you already have had eleven thousand. Most rules work
both ways. But you don’t really want to go back?”</p>

<p>“I do. It’s been growing for some time and now it’s
ingrowing. You can get enough of anything and I’ve had
enough of Europe. Besides, I’d like to get back to a
country where lifts are elevators and don’t go to sleep a
few times on the way up; where it doesn’t take an hour<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[181]</span>
to draw a bath, which it does wherever it’s pronounced
băth; where you can drink plain water, and don’t have
cheese or garlic or grease in all your food; where you are
never taken for what you ain’t; where you are never
cheated and overcharged because you’re an American;
where you don’t have to see a sight a minute; where you
don’t have to talk up to people who don’t give a hang
about anything that interests you; where you are not
looked upon as a rank outsider by ancient aristocrats and
concierges, no matter how polite they try to be; and where
the word democracy means what it is. Over here every
socialist—I’ll bet every anarchist—would give his front
teeth to be a king, a duke, or even a rich bourgeois. That’s
what’s the matter with all of them. Give me America,
above all, old Montana. A little money and a lot of ‘go’
are all you need out there.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Ida! Ida! will you never appreciate the glory of
Europe? Is that all you have got out of it?”</p>

<p>“I’ve squeezed it dry, all right, and I’ll take back a lot
more than I figured on. Watch me when I’m swelling
round Butte, imitating the chaste simplicity of a British
duchess—minus the duds they generally sport. There’s
nothing like Europe to teach you what’s what—especially
the way we’ve seen it—put you wise in ten thousand different
ways, and fill your mind with pretty pictures—that
ain’t in galleries. But after all it’s just a course in the
higher education, and you’re outside of it all, every minute.
To live you’ve got to go back to your own country.”</p>

<p>“That’s true enough!”</p>

<p>“Could you marry a European and live over here for
the rest of your life and never see those mountains again
that just seem to belong to you—or even screaming old
Butte?”</p>

<p>“No!” Ora spoke with uncommon vehemence. “I
couldn’t!”</p>

<p>Ida raised herself on her elbow and looked at her friend
shrewdly. “I can’t see that you’ve enjoyed yourself so
much over here. It seems to me that you’ve got your fun
out of showing me round. You had more real gaiety in
you in Butte. You may not know it but you look pretty
sad sometimes.”</p>

<p>“Life is sad—mighty sad.”</p>

<p>“Is it? That’s a new one for me. I think it a pretty<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[182]</span>
fine old proposition. What went wrong with you—early
in the game?”</p>

<p>“Nothing. Travel is tiring, I’m not as strong as you
are.”</p>

<p>“You’re as tough as a pine knot, for all you look like a
lily expecting to be decapitated by the first wind. Well,
you won’t tell if you won’t, but I’ll tell you what you need.
You’ve never been in love and that’s a sort of ache in
women until they’ve taken a good dose of the only medicine.
I rather hoped you’d met your fate in the Marchese
Valdobia. He’s the sort you once told me was your type,
and you seemed to like him pretty well for about five
weeks in Rome. The lord knows he was tall enough, and
dark enough, and thin enough, and looked as if he had a
beastly temper besides. Then you turned him down good
and hard. I was sorry——”</p>

<p>“My dear Ida! Are you regretting that I did not
have a liaison with Valdobia? I remember your virtuous
sentiments in Butte. Perhaps it is time for us to return!”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’m all right. But I’m that advanced I wouldn’t
mind you having an affair the least bit if it would make
you happy——”</p>

<p>“Happy! What happiness do you imagine there can
be when you are absolutely at the mercy of a man?—when
you never know whether you will see him again or not?—a
woman has no real hold on a lover. Matrimony with
the man you love may have its agonies, but at least you
live with him, you make his home; his interests are yours,
he is dependent upon you for comfort and sympathy;
there are a thousand ways in which you can endear and
enchain him. But a lover, whom you meet in secret for
one purpose only, who can give you no real companionship—oh,
no! I shall not court that particular form of suffering.
Life is hard enough without that! I’ve known women
with lovers and so have you.”</p>

<p>“I don’t say it would last forever; nothing does, for
that matter. But at least you would live for a little while—come
down off the unearthly plane you roost on now.
Whatever you went through, it would leave you all-round
developed and philosophical—in a frame of mind to see
and accept life as it is. You need hardening. I was born
hard. You’re as soft as mush, for all you look like those
marble bores in the Vatican, and as romantic as if you’d<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[183]</span>
spent all your life in a castle in a wood with the drawbridge
up. I believe you even keep a diary——”</p>

<p>“Diary——” Ora sat up straight.</p>

<p>“I’ve seen and heard you writing by the yard, late at
night, mostly. It wasn’t letters, because we always get
those off our chest just after breakfast—fine system. Unless
you’re a budding author——”</p>

<p>“They were letters!” Ora, who was strung up to a
high pitch and merely smoking for relief, felt a defiant
impulse to indulge in the impudence of confession. “I’ve
written yards and yards of letters to a man——”</p>

<p>“What? And you don’t send them off!”</p>

<p>“I don’t know him.”</p>

<p>“Good lord, what next? An ideal, I suppose.”</p>

<p>“Yes—that’s it.”</p>

<p>“Do you mean you never saw him—anyone to suggest
him—it? What gender has an ideal, anyhow?”</p>

<p>“I saw him—talked with him, once. I said I didn’t
know him.”</p>

<p>“And you’re in love with him!”</p>

<p>“Not in the least. He simply jolted my imagination,
gave me the idea of what might be—have been. I—it is
hard to express—I feel in a sort of mental—spiritual?—affinity
with him. When I write I have a queer sense of
absolute communion—as if we were talking—I suppose it
is because I know he would understand if I could send
the letters——”</p>

<p>“And you’ve never sent one?”</p>

<p>“Of course not. It is—well, just a little private one-sided
drama I’m living; a sort of book of which I am
the heroine. While I write I am alive. The rest of the
time I wonder what I was put on this earth at all for.”</p>

<p>“Look at here, Ora, the best thing we can do is to send
for old Gower and go back to Rome. You’ll be having
nerves first thing you know. No, we’d cut out the annex.
I’m dead sick of her, and everybody knows we’re all right;
in Rome they don’t care, anyhow. You could have a real
romance. We’d take one of those old palaces, haunted,
moth-eaten, with one of those antique porters that looks
as if he’d let out midnight lovers ten centuries ago, and
beds that twenty centuries have died in. That would just
suit you. I’d enjoy a second-hand romance first rate, and
be the trusted friend.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[184]</span>“Ida, you are incorrigible! Even if I cared a penny
about Valdobia do you suppose I would betray my husband?”</p>

<p>“Rats! Don’t you suppose Mark has a girl down on
The Flat? Greg has, I’ll bet—well, don’t look as if you
were going to faint. What’s the use of being a dog in
the manger? Mark’ll be the same old devoted when you
get back.”</p>

<p>“Oh, do keep quiet! And I wish I might never see
Butte again. I think I’ll write to Mark and ask him to
move to New York. He now has plenty of money to wait,
and it wouldn’t take him long to establish himself anywhere——”</p>

<p>“I thought you loved Montana—wanted to do something
big for her——”</p>

<p>“We’ve been away a long time. I fancy I’m weaned.
It is only once in a while that I feel a pull—merely because
I was born there.”</p>

<p>“Well, Mark won’t leave, believe me. He’s Western
from the cut of his back hair to his love of the free-and-easy.
No New York for him except the all-night two or
three times a year. Butte’s your fate unless you leave
him.”</p>

<p>“I’ll never do that, but I’d like to stay over here for
another year or two. Remember, I was brought up in
Europe—and—and—I <i>might</i> meet the man—If you want
to know I’ve tried. I’d never go as far as you suggest,
but I could get something—companionship, perhaps, out
of it.”</p>

<p>“When you meet the man you’ll forget all you ever
knew, and men don’t companion for a cent when there’s
nothing in it. I haven’t been turning them inside out
these last six months for nothing; what I don’t know
about men wouldn’t fill a thimble. Why don’t you round
up your letter-man?”</p>

<p>“That is forever impossible.”</p>

<p>“Do give me a hint who he is. I’m half dead with
curiosity. Where’d you meet him?”</p>

<p>“Keep quiet. I’m going to take a nap.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Ida, yawning and stretching herself, “so
am I, if you’ve closed up. When we get back to Butte
and there’s no more sight-seeing on, we’ll have to cut out
these siestas or we’ll get fat, and then good-bye.”</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">XXXII</h3>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THEY went out at half-past five and joined the dense
sauntering throng under the arcade of the Via Venti
Settembre. All Genoa turns out at this hour with apparently
no object but to amble and stare. The two girls, particularly
Ora, who appeared to be the only blonde in the
city, were almost mobbed. Every other man spoke to
them, or rolled his eyes and twirled his moustache. But
they preserved a lofty and blank demeanour, and were
practically unmolested. The Genoese works almost as hard
as the American during a few hours of the day and haunts
the afternoon throngs only to amuse himself indolently.
If one woman ignores him he passes on philosophically to
the next.</p>

<p>“Lord, but I’d like to get a move on!” exclaimed Ida.
“Why don’t they <i>walk</i>? Is this what they call exercise?
And I wouldn’t mind their ogling and speaking if they
only wouldn’t pinch. I’ll give this side a rest, anyhow.”
And she dexterously changed places and drew
Ora’s other arm through her own.</p>

<p>“I love them, pinches and all,” said Ora, warmly.
“They are like children in one way, and yet they really
know how to rest and enjoy themselves, which is more
than our men ever do. Even the working-class enjoys
life over here. I wonder why they emigrate?”</p>

<p>They had passed round the corner of the arcade and
entered the Piazza Defarrari, working their way toward
the Via Roma. Ora stopped before one of the cantinas
behind the statue of Garibaldi. “Look at those men drinking
their cheap wine and gossipping. They look as if they
hadn’t a care in the world.”</p>

<p>“Give me the hustling American,” said Ida contemptuously.
“I don’t call this life. They’re just drifting along
waiting for the Angel Gabriel to blow his trump. What
makes them so lazy and contented? They know they can<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[186]</span>
go just so far over here and no farther. Ancient history
made classes and masses, and while they have fun, some
of them, thinking they’re socialists, they know that most
of them will stay put. But the only real fun in life is
getting ahead of the next fellow and knowing that your
chance is as good as any.”</p>

<p>“What a truly American sentiment!”</p>

<p>“I’m American, all right, and that’s the reason I want
to get back to Butte, where things hum every minute, and
there’s no real poverty. Fancy calling these left-overs
‘middle-class’ like our miners. Every one of those looks
forward to being President of Amalgamated one of these
days, or striking it rich in the mountains.”</p>

<p>“There are different varieties of happiness, fortunately
for several billions that are seeking it.”</p>

<p>“Do you know,” said Ida, abruptly, as they turned into
the Galleria Mazzini from the Via Roma, “it’s queer, but
I feel more at home in Italy than I have anywhere else
over here, although I had a really better time in England
and Germany and Austria. I don’t hit it off much with
Italians, but—well—I have a more settled-down feeling.”</p>

<p>“That’s odd!”</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’ve been romancing about you a bit, fancying
you a reincarnation of one of those fascinating abominable
women of the Renaissance, who had innumerable lovers
and poisoned their husbands, or rivals. You would look
quite wonderful in those long velvet or brocaded gowns,
with sleeves that come down over the hands, and pearls
twined in your hair.”</p>

<p>“That’s not a bad idea. Maybe I was, although I don’t
see myself with lovers or thinking anybody worth swinging
for. Several American reincarnations must have changed
my habits; but I don’t mind looking the part. Good idea—when
we get back to Paris I’ll have several of those
Renaissance costumes made. They won’t go out of style,
either. Greg can fork over the pearls later.”</p>

<p>“You’ll be a picture. I wish I had thought of it before.
Don’t you think you are capable of jealousy?”</p>

<p>“Nixie. To be jealous you’ve got to have a fearful
crush; and thank the lord I don’t love anybody but myself
and never shall.”</p>

<p>“That is often the secret of love for some man—of most<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[187]</span>
men’s love for a woman, I imagine! Perhaps it creates
the most powerful delusion of all.”</p>

<p>“Well, none of it in mine. Me for the great society act.
I’m going to be the grandest dame in Montana, and when
I’ve wrung that dry I’ll move on to New York. Greg says
he won’t, means to live and die in Montana, but I guess
he’ll manage to stand it if I desert him occasionally. If
he’s got a hill full of copper he won’t know whether I’m
in Butte or the Waldorf-Astoria. You look better, Ora;
you ought to stay out of doors more and watch these funny
old crowds. You’ve got a nice colour, and smile as if you
meant it—Oh! that’s it, is it? Well, thank goodness, I’ve
got a front seat——”</p>

<p>“What on earth are you talking about?”</p>

<p>“Pretending you haven’t seen him? I like that!”</p>

<p>Ida felt the arm within her own stiffen. “Valdobia!
Don’t leave me for a moment.”</p>

<p>“I won’t, although, believe me, the rôle of gooseberry
is no cinch.”</p>

<p>“I’ve played it for you often enough.”</p>

<p>“You have, and I’m a dead game sport. Lord! he looks
more bad-tempered than ever. Probably every meal he’s
eaten since you left has disagreed with him, including
macaroni.”</p>

<p>“He’s not bad-tempered. Hot-tempered, no doubt, but
I’m sure he’s kind and quite amiable. He’s rather grim,
and of course he’s lived pretty hard and is disillusioned.
That is all.”</p>

<p>“That’s right, stand up for him. Bad sign—or a good
one! He’s seen us!”</p>

<p>Valdobia’s eyes flashed recognition, although he lifted
his hat with unsmiling lips, and made no effort to push his
way through the crowd. Ora favoured him with a glance
of chill indifference as she returned his salutation, but she
noticed that he made the young Genoese patricians look
provincial. He not only was tall and gracefully built, his
carriage military, but he had the air of repose and
distinction, as well as the keen, tolerant, detached glance,
of the man who has spent his life in the great world, and,
on the whole, subordinated his weaknesses to his brain. It
was evident that he was dressed from Conduit Street, and
at first glance, in spite of his dark colouring and fine
Roman features, his nationality was not obtrusive; he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[188]</span>
looked the cosmopolitan, the man-of-the-world, who might
have made his headquarters in any one of her great capitals.
As a matter of fact, while in the diplomatic service
he had lived in several, including a short sojourn in Washington;
but after coming into a large inheritance through
the death of his father and of an energetic uncle who had
boldly gone into business and prospered, he had travelled
for a year in Africa and India and then settled in Rome.</p>

<p>If he was too indifferent or too wise to hurry he managed
to make his way consistently toward them, although
a crowd had formed about a bulletin board to read the
latest news from the seat of war. He stood opposite them
in three or four minutes and shook hands politely with
both.</p>

<p>“At last!” he said. “I called at the Bristol, and have
been looking for you ever since.” He had a warm deep
voice but his tones and manner expressed less than his
words.</p>

<p>“You don’t have to look far in Genoa,” said Ida, giving
him a cordial smile and handshake to cover Ora’s chilling
welcome. “If the whole town turns out for what it calls
exercise, each quarter seems to keep to itself. We see the
same faces every day.”</p>

<p>Valdobia fell into step beside Ida, who at once began
to chatter questions about their common acquaintance in
Rome. She grinned mentally as she rattled off titles, recalling
the wiry little figure of her mother at the wash-tub,
and her father with his “muck”-spattered overalls
and blue dinner pail; but Valdobia, too accustomed to
titles to note whether Americans were lavish in their use
or not, replied naturally and refrained from glancing at
the woman who had given his self-centred ego the profoundest
shock it had ever received. He was now thirty-eight.
In his early manhood he had loved with the facility
and brevity of his race. Then for six years, after his
return to Rome, he had been the lover of a brilliant and
subtle woman ten years older than himself, who, for a
short time, inspired in him the belief that at last he had
entered the equatorial region of the <i>grande passion</i>. This
passed off, and she became a habit, which lasted until, with
the decline of her beauty, she lost much of her finesse, as
well as her control over both temper and complexion. It
had taken him a year or more to regain his liberty, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[189]</span>
when he did, after scenes that he fain would dismiss from
his memory, he determined to keep it. His long experience
with a woman of many characteristics and one or two
noble qualities, before she gossipped and inflamed them to
death, had thoroughly disillusioned him, and since his
release his gallantries had been lighter than in his youth.
When he first met Ora Blake he was attracted merely by
her cold fairness, redeemed from classic severity by her
brilliant seeing eyes, which so often sparkled with humour,
and amused at her naïve and girlish attitude of happiness
in temporary freedom; so successfully practised by herself
and Ida. He had supposed her to be little more than
twenty, and had wondered if her husband were even
busier than the average American, to let her run away so
soon. When she told him she was twenty-seven, and had
been married seven years, he found himself speculating on
the temperament of a woman whom time and life had left
untouched. Shortly after, he received a biographical
sketch of her from Mrs. O’Neil, also of Butte, who was
wintering in Rome and entertaining such of the aristocracy
as she met at her Embassy. It was some time since his
thoughts had dwelt upon any woman when alone, and when
he found himself sitting by his window in the evening
dreaming over his cigar instead of amusing himself in the
varied life of Rome after his habit, he was at first amused,
then angry, finally apprehensive. He had no desire for
another period of torment, followed by the successive
stages that finished in impatience and satiety.</p>

<p>He tried flirting with her, making her talk about herself,
focussing her mind on the years she seemed determined
to ignore, in the hope of discovering that she was
commonplace. But Ora, who found him more interesting
than any man she had met in Europe, also a conquest to
be proud of, continued to make herself interesting—and
elusive—with a skill and subtlety that so closely resembled
the frank ingenuousness of the West, that the man accustomed
to the patented finesse of European women experienced
the agreeable sensation of renewing his youth.
He felt himself falling in love like a schoolboy, and meditated
flight. He remained in Rome, however, and made
a deliberate attempt to fascinate her. Then one day
when Ida was pouring tea at the Embassy, chaperoned
by Lady Gower, he found Ora alone, indisposed after a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[190]</span>
sleepless night, and lost his head. Ora, who was in no
mood to let him down gently and reserve him for conversational
pleasures, dismissed him abruptly, and had not
seen him since. She had regretted her impatience, for he
was always worth talking to, her feminine liking for his
type was very strong, and she had amused herself fancying
that if she had not permitted another man to rule her
imagination she might have found her fate in this
one. But as he had presumed to follow her when she
had banished him summarily, she greeted him with
cool civility and resumed her study of the kaleidoscopic
crowd.</p>

<p>Suddenly she moved her head in a fashion that suggested
the lifting of one of the little ears that lay so close
to her head and were not the least of her points. The ear
was on the side next to her companion in arms. Could it
be that Ida was flirting with Valdobia? Mrs. Compton’s
manner and speech were as correct as her smartly tailored
suit and hat of black velvet and the calm pride of her
bearing, but she was talking with sweet earnestness to
the Roman about himself and expressing her plaintive
gratitude that he had cared to follow them to Genoa, where
she at least was very lonely. It had not been possible for
Ora to see the flash of understanding these two had exchanged
after Valdobia’s first puzzled glance, but she did
see many heads turn to look at the handsome and well-matched
couple. Even the Italian women did not smile
ironically as they so often did at the too obvious American
tourist. Ida not only had delivered herself of every exterior
trace of commonness, but would no more have appeared
on the street looking the mere tourist than she
could be betrayed into adopting the extreme of any new
style by the persuasive Parisian. She saw Ora’s head
come round her shoulder, and her voice deepened to the
soft husky tones she reserved for decisive moments with
her agitated admirers, then dropped so low that only the
man, with his head bent, could hear the words. At this
stage of the flirtation’s progress Ora noted that the approving
glances of the sympathetic Italians were accompanied
by significant smiles.</p>

<p>They had reached the end of the long Galleria for the
second time and turned. The crowd was thin. The restaurants
were filling. Shutters were rattling down over<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[191]</span>
the windows of the tempting shops. Said Ora abruptly,</p>

<p>“I think I’d like to dine in one of these cafés—the Milano.
The Bristol dining-room is a little Ritz, and it’s a
bore to dress.”</p>

<p>Valdobia leaned forward with a pleasant smile. “I
should like nothing better, but you must dine with me.”</p>

<p>“Why not? What do you say, Ida?”</p>

<p>“I’d love it. The food is good and the crowd more
interesting.”</p>

<p>They entered the bright café and seated themselves at
one of the side tables, the two girls on the bench against
the wall, Valdobia in the chair opposite. A number of
the tables were already occupied, several by stout comfortable
couples, but the majority by men with their hats
on, playing dominoes or reading the evening papers. Opposite
the door was a long table set forth with the delicacies
of the season: raw meat, winter vegetables, oranges, and
kicking lobsters.</p>

<p>Valdobia, assiduously waited upon by the proprietor
himself (whose wife, surrounded by several of her children,
smiled benignantly from the cashier’s desk), ordered a
special dinner; a light soup (the table d’hôte soup was a
meal in itself), spaghetti, inimitably cooked veal in brown
butter, salad, freshly caught fish, ices, and a bottle of the
host’s most precious Chianti.</p>

<p>“I never could have pictured you in a Bohemian restaurant,”
said Ora, smiling brilliantly into the face of
her host. “Have you ever been in a place like this before?”</p>

<p>“About as often as I have weeks to my credit.” He
looked steadily into her snapping eyes. “You have studied
Italians to little purpose if you’ve not discovered their
partiality for their native cooking. These plain little
cafés are the last strongholds in our large cities. Even
the restaurants where the business men go for luncheon
are queer imitations of London or Paris.”</p>

<p>“We like to come here because the men pay no attention
to us. It is men of your class that know how to make us
thoroughly uncomfortable.”</p>

<p>“Quite so. Every class has its own code. In ours it
may be said that the women set the pace. They demand
open admiration and we are gallant enough to give it.
This class bothers itself little about the unattainable, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[192]</span>
merely throws you the passing tribute they would throw
to the Queen, or to a beautiful work of art.”</p>

<p>“Which they appreciate. Would that our working-classes
did. On this side the masses are as likely as not
to spend their holidays in a picture gallery or a museum.
Ours can think of nothing better than a saloon.”</p>

<p>“That may be the fault of your great country. The
crude mind is easily trained. Give your working-people
more galleries and museums and fewer saloons—or cantinas
with their light wines, and beer gardens, instead of rum
and whiskey. But it is unfair to expect a new and heterogeneous—almost
chaotic—country to compete with twenty
centuries.” Two pairs of American eyes flashed, and he
continued suavely. “I fear that the old standards of
my own people are in danger of being demoralised by
socialism and the new craving for raw spirits. That is
becoming a serious question with us.” He turned to Ida.
“It is far more odd to see you without your usual train
of admirers—both of you. How do you stand it?”</p>

<p>“Oh, we’re merely recuperating,” said Ida lightly, and
smiling into his admiring eyes. “We will return to the
fray refreshed and more dangerous than ever.”</p>

<p>“How much longer shall you stay here?”</p>

<p>“A week or two. Then we go on to Paris. After that
Egypt, Spain, or some other old place.”</p>

<p>“But not without seeing Monte Carlo? You must let
me show it to you.”</p>

<p>“I suppose that is an old stamping ground of yours?”</p>

<p>“I go once a year, although, like a good many other
pleasures, it has lost its irresistible fascination. But I
shall enjoy seeing you catch the gambling fever.”</p>

<p>“I’m not very susceptible to microbes, but I don’t doubt
Mrs. Blake will gamble the clothes off her back. That
would be the good old Montana style.” And she told him
something of life in Butte before it indulged in one of its
spasms of exterior reform, and of the present life on The
Flat.</p>

<p>“I must see your Butte,” he said enthusiastically. “An
English friend of mine has a ranch in Wyoming, and I
may go out there next year.”</p>

<p>Ora stood this until the fish had been removed; then she
emerged conclusively from the cold and nervous apathy
that had possessed her for several days, and began to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[193]</span>
sparkle. Ida was no match for her when she chose to
exert herself, for that native product only really shone
when able to employ her own rich vocabulary. She subsided
with a smile and devoted herself to the excellent
dinner, while Ora entertained their fastidious host with
bright little stories of the adventures they never failed to
experience, being two young women who travelled with
their eyes and ears wide open. Valdobia, now satisfied
that he had recaptured the interest of his lady and been
in a measure forgiven, gave her all his attention; although
not a man disposed to conversational exertion, he took
pains to interest her in return. They discussed the news
of the day and the latest books; and his deference to her
opinions was very flattering, although he did not permit a
flash of his eyes to betray his passionate delight at being
once more with this woman whom he thought lovelier and
more desirable than ever. Ora wore a blue velvet suit,
not too dark, and a little hat of the same shade with a
long feather that nestled in her warm ashen hair. Her
cheeks were as pink as her lips, and she held her chin up
as if drinking in the elixir of her native air. She looked
very young and wholly without guile.</p>

<p>She continued to enchant him until they were in the
Bristol, and the lift stopped at the first floor. Then she
abruptly bade him good-night, and ascended to her room,
while the others went into the smoking-room and ordered
coffee at one of the smaller tables.</p>

<p>“Well?” said Ida, smiling. “I’m not the sort that
talks in circles except when I’m on parade. I’m glad
you’ve come. Ora was fearfully down about something.
I believe she likes you better than any man she has met
over here. A little flirtation will do her no end of good.”</p>

<p>Valdobia coloured. He was as practical as most Italians,
but by no means given to the direct method of speech with
women. Love simplifies among other things, however, and
after a moment he put down his cup and looked her
straight in the eyes.</p>

<p>“I think I shall take you into my confidence,” he said.
“I know that you are honest and that I can trust to your
discretion——”</p>

<p>“You bet.”</p>

<p>Ida relaxed her spine with her speech and settled herself
comfortably.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[194]</span>“And you could give me great assistance. I want to
persuade your friend—may I call her Ora to you? It is
a beautiful name and I have said it so often to myself——”</p>

<p>“Ora goes.”</p>

<p>“I want to persuade Ora to divorce her husband and
marry me.”</p>

<p>“Aw—that is—Good Lord!” Ida sat up straight and
nearly dropped her cup. “That’s a large order.”</p>

<p>“Rather. But I—now—want nothing less. I am sick
of the other sort of thing, even if she were not too good
for it. I want to marry—and she is the only woman I
ever have wanted to marry.”</p>

<p>“Hm. You Italians haven’t the name of being the best
husbands in the world. How long would you be faithful
to her?”</p>

<p>“I have no intention of ever being anything else.”</p>

<p>“That’s what they all say—think, no doubt.”</p>

<p>“I shall be.” He spoke with intense conviction.</p>

<p>“Well, perhaps—you’ve lived your life. I should think
you men would get mighty sick of dancing about and
never coming to anchor. But divorce? There’s Mark, you
know.”</p>

<p>“Her present husband?”</p>

<p>“Yes, and a rattling good fellow. He married Ora
when she didn’t know which way to turn, and she is really
grateful to him, and as fond of him as if he were her own
brother. I don’t think she’ll turn him down.”</p>

<p>“Women have been known to desert their brothers before
this! I mean to make her love me, and if I do—how she
could love a man!—I fancy I can persuade her.”</p>

<p>“I like Mark and I don’t want to see him thrown down.
He’s not what you might call in love with Ora—he got
discouraged pretty early in the game. But he’s fond of
her and proud of her, and he has ambitions. She could
help him a lot.”</p>

<p>Valdobia lit another cigarette.</p>

<p>“Better have a liaison and get over it. Then he’ll never
know, and what men don’t know don’t hurt them.”</p>

<p>“I shall do nothing of the sort. I mean to marry her.
Will you help me or not?”</p>

<p>“Ora’d look fine all right in that old palace of yours.
It would suit her a long sight better than Butte, or even
Washington—let alone Helena; Mark wouldn’t mind a bit<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[195]</span>
being Governor of Montana. Have you got a castle in
the country?”</p>

<p>“I have several.”</p>

<p>“Fine! I’d visit you every year.”</p>

<p>“No one would be half as welcome.”</p>

<p>“I’ve been away from America so long and seen so
much, and Butte seems so far away, that I’ve kind of lost
my bearings. If you’d come over there and lay your
siege, I guess I’d fight you to the last ditch.”</p>

<p>“Permit me to remind you that we are in Italy, a state
several centuries ahead of yours in civilisation, even if we
lack your facile divorce laws. I know something of Mr.
Blake from Mrs. O’Neil. Can you picture Ora finishing
her life with him?”</p>

<p>“No, I can’t, and that’s a fact. I wonder there hasn’t
been a grand bust-up before this. It will come some day.
Why not now?”</p>

<p>“Quite so.”</p>

<p>“And Mark could get a dozen girls to suit him better,
make him nice and comfy. He’ll never get any real companionship
out of Ora, fine as she’s always treated him.
A man like that needs a running mate.”</p>

<p>“I shall waste none of my mental energy in sympathy
for Mr. Mark Blake. American husbands, so far as I have
been permitted to observe, are accustomed not only to
being deserted for months and even years at a time, but to
periodical divorce.”</p>

<p>“It’s not quite as bad as that, but Mark has the elasticity
of an india rubber ball, and that’s a fact.”</p>

<p>“Good. Will you help me?”</p>

<p>Ida hesitated an instant longer, then, dimly conscious
that her answer in a measure was dictated by a profound
instinct she made no attempt to define, exclaimed, “It’s a
go. I believe it will be all for the best. Shake.” And she
gave his hand a hearty grasp.</p>

<p>“You are a brick,” he murmured, with a sensation of
gratitude he had rarely experienced. “But there is one
thing more. Please give her no hint of this, for the present
at least. Tell her, and make her believe it, that I have
not come here to trouble her, that she need never fear to
trust herself alone with me. Tell her that I only want to
enjoy her society and make things pleasant for her.”</p>

<p>“Right you are. Ora’s not the sort you can rush. But<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[196]</span>
don’t overdo it and make her think you’ve altogether got
over it. Sometimes that piques and works out all right
and sometimes it don’t. She’s as proud as Lucifer and
might get over her fancy for you while she was still mad.”</p>

<p>“You do know your sex! I’ll use all the art I’ve ever
acquired.”</p>

<p>“Respectful devotion without humility, and pained self-control.
That’s your lay.”</p>

<p>He laughed heartily. “We’ll drift for the present.”</p>

<p>“Well, now, drift out. I want to go up and sound her.
I’m simply expiring to know what she’s thinking about
at the present moment.”</p>

<p class="drop-cap">WHEN Ida reached her room she put her ear to the
closed door leading into Ora’s, and heard the
scratch of the hotel pen.</p>

<p>“May I come in?” she asked softly.</p>

<p>There was a rattle of paper, the snap of a trunk lid,
and then Ora said in tones as dulcet, “Come in, dear.”</p>

<p>Ida entered and found Ora extended on the sofa.</p>

<p>“What did you run off like that for?” she asked, as
she selected the least uncomfortable of the chairs in the
fresh and artistic but hardly luxurious room. “The poor
man was as glum as a funeral until he’d had two cups of
coffee and several cigarettes.”</p>

<p>“I was tired. And I really think he has followed you.”</p>

<p>“You don’t think anything of the sort. His heart was
in his patent leathers when he met us, and I just tided
him over. He gave me a message for you. Shall I deliver
it?”</p>

<p>“Why not?” asked Ora languidly.</p>

<p>“He wants me to impress you with the fact that he’s not
come here to make love to you, just to enjoy your exhilarating
society——”</p>

<p>“Is he over it?” Ora’s eyes flashed upward.</p>

<p>“Not exactly, but he has no intention of making any
more breaks, and being cut off from the solace of your
company now and then—principally now, I guess. He’s
got to see you or go off to India and shoot tigers. But
he’s really much nicer than I had any idea of, and is anxious
to give us a good time. Life is a desert, kid, with
all the men we know in the next town. Men were invented
to amuse us, so do continue to thaw. You did bravely
when you got started, and no harm will be done. If you
can’t fall in love with him you can’t, and he’s prepared<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[198]</span>
to take his medicine. He’s a good sport. A man like that
can behave himself when he sets his mind to it.”</p>

<p>“Is he indulging in the hope that I can be made to care
for him?”</p>

<p>“Men are so conceited that they always hope for the
best. But he’ll not worry you, that’s the point. It will
be fine to have him pilot us about; perhaps he’ll get us
inside of one of those old palaces in the Via Garibaldi.
And he’ll take us to Monte Carlo. How do you feel about
it?”</p>

<p>“I don’t care whether he goes or stays, but on the whole
I am rather glad he is here. He has brains and I like to
talk to clever men that have seen the world.”</p>

<p>“And don’t keep me hitched to your elbow all the time,
for mercy’s sake. I hope he’ll dig up some friend of his
here who will beau me. Give him a chance and remember
he is a gentleman and has passed his word.”</p>

<p>“Is this a plot?” Ora laughed. “Don’t worry. I
won’t bore you any more than I can help. I fancy I am
quite safe, for he never really can see me alone, as we
have no salon here. Besides, in long days of sight-seeing
he’ll no doubt recover, and we shall become merely the
best of friends.”</p>

<p>“That’s what I’m figuring on. Now, cut out those
love letters and come down to earth.”</p>

<p>Ora sat up in her indignation. “Love letters? I’ve not
written a line of love.”</p>

<p>“What in the name of goodness do you write about then
to this lover in the air?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I just—<i>talk</i>—about everything that interests me—the
things one says to a familiar spirit—that is if there
were such a thing—but otherwise has to keep to oneself
always.”</p>

<p>“And you don’t call them love letters, because you leave
out the ‘darlings’ and ‘dears’? Good thing the man will
never see them. Good thing for more reasons than one.
Men hate long letters. If I’d disobeyed orders and inflicted
Greg, I never would have got that house and the
extra ten thousand.”</p>

<p>“And yet he was in love with you once?”</p>

<p>“Thought he was. Just had the usual attack of brain
fever men always get when they can’t have the girl they
want without marrying her. Lasted about a month. Greg<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[199]</span>
cares too much for other things for any woman to last
more than a few minutes in his life, anyway. Just the
husband for me.”</p>

<p>Ora was swinging one foot and looking at the point of
her slipper.</p>

<p>“I shan’t destroy those letters,” she said finally, “because
they have meant something to me that nothing in
this life ever will again. But I’ll write no more.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>They remained in Genoa for ten days longer. Valdobia,
who had taken rooms at the Miramare, gave them a dinner
and they met several of his Genoese friends, but none of
the men was blest with Ida’s critical approval. Her demand
for the admiration of men was merely a part of her
insolent pride in her beauty and magnetism and her love
of power; she had little natural coquetry, and wasted no
time on a man who bored her or was not “worth while.”
She particularly hated soft dark eyes, and the two unfortunate
young scions of the aristocracy of Genoa invited
by Valdobia, had peculiarly lovely orbs that they rolled
exceedingly. But it was a merry party, for no people
can be gayer than the Genoese, and they played baccarat
until two in the morning; a new experience for the Americans.
During the hours devoted to the game Ida had the
satisfaction of observing that two pairs of flaming dark
eyes had apparently forgotten the existence of woman.
Even Valdobia, who held the bank twice and lost a good
deal of money, became very keen on the table, although
he kept Ora beside him and taught her all that one can
learn of a game of chance. The stakes ran very high toward
the end, Valdobia lost several thousand francs, and
Ora five hundred. She would have lost more, no doubt,
for she found it an interesting and exciting experience,
but Valdobia dictated her stakes, and she meekly obeyed.
Ida, who had been wary, came out even.</p>

<p>“You don’t catch me dropping good money when I
don’t get something good enough in return,” she announced
as they entered her room at the hotel. “It’s fun
all right, but like most things that are off on a side-track
from your main purpose in life, just to be nibbled at. I
prefer bridge anyhow.”</p>

<p>“Do you? I think I like the game of chance. I don’t
mind losing——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[200]</span>“Well, I do. It made me sick to see you lose five hundred
francs, and if it hadn’t been for Valdobia you’d have
lost as much more. I couldn’t sleep a wink if I’d lost a
hundred plunks.”</p>

<p>Ora laughed. “It would be great fun to see you really
excited and carried away about something. I hope you
will have visions of sudden wealth at Monte Carlo and
forget the world.”</p>

<p>“Not much!” said Ida contemptuously. “I’ll be rich,
all right, but it’ll be because I take no chances. I knew
whom I was marrying, and he’ll make the millions. You’ll
never see me spend a cent unless it brings in good interest,
like clothes, and tips, and entertaining. And the only
thing that could excite me would be if Amalgamated got
the hill, and Greg had to go to work to make his fortune
as a mining engineer. But I’m not the kind to get
wrinkles worrying. Lord! Don’t the people in this town
ever go to sleep?”</p>

<p>Their windows were close to the Via Venti Settembre,
although on a short side street. It is possible that the
afternoon throngs are replaced by a different set in the
evening, and these again by lovers of the night; but certain
it is that the more inviting of the streets are rarely deserted
until dawn, and the later the revellers the more noisy
they are; following a universal law of nature. When the
light-hearted Genoese has sung all his songs to the stars
and chattered at the top of his voice for several hours,
he stands still and screams. The girls put their heads out
of the window, wondering if anyone were being murdered
below. A group of young men were standing in a circle
and outscreaming one another.</p>

<p>Ida slammed the long windows together, fastened the
catch and covered them with the heavy shutters. “Me for
beauty sleep,” she said; “I like air all right, but I like
quiet better. Good night.”</p>

<p>Ora left her window open and lay thinking for a long
time. She liked the new excitement of gambling, and she
was divided between regret and gratitude that for the last
five days she had enjoyed thoroughly the society of the
man who would have been the chief exponent of the type
she admired had he possessed more primitive strength of
personality; had he been obliged to develop his native
forces in a fierce battle with life instead of having been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[201]</span>
from, birth one of her favourites. But he was a man, brave,
unsoftened by luxury, quick, keen, resourceful, modern
to his finger-tips, an almost perfect companion. What
more could any woman ask? Ora wondered just what it
was she did ask. She felt very grateful to him, however.
Her regret was that her unreal life seemed to be over, or
slept profoundly when she perversely and tentatively summoned
it. That life had been terrible in its intensity, only
retreating now and again when real events crowded, or
she deliberately tried to interest herself in a new and
charming personality. But all men sooner or later faded
to the transparency of wraiths beside the vital figure that
dominated her imaginative life. Would Valdobia accomplish
the miracle? At least he gave her peace for the
moment. She fell asleep smiling and deliberately thinking
of him.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">XXXIV</h3>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">ON the following day they lunched at a large restaurant
opposite the Bourse, a favourite resort of the two
girls; it amused them to watch the keen clever business
men of Genoa at their midday meal in leisurely conversation
and enjoyment of their excellent food and wine;
contrasting them with the American who took five minutes
for lunch, achieving dyspepsia instead of nutriment, and
possibly accomplishing less than a race which has been
commercial and acquisitive since the dawn of its history.
There is little real poverty in Genoa and great wealth.</p>

<p>They had come too late to secure one of the tables overlooking
the Piazzi Defarrari, and were facing the windows,
at one of the longer tables, when Valdobia, who sat opposite,
rose with a word of apology and went behind them
to greet a man with a pleasant English voice.</p>

<p>“Lord John Mowbray,” whispered Ida. “He’s all
right, but, lord, I’ll be glad to get back to a country where
a few men are plain mister.”</p>

<p>Nevertheless, as the Englishman bent over her with a
delighted word of greeting, she lifted her heavy eyes to
his with the expression of one whose long suppressed hopes
have blossomed at last.</p>

<p>“I wish I could join you,” he said ruefully, “but I am
with a party of friends.”</p>

<p>“Get rid of them after lunch,” murmured Ida, “and
come with us. We are going to explore all those interesting
little streets down in the gulch—that is to say the
ravine, or whatever it was once—and it would be jolly to
have you along.”</p>

<p>“I will,” he said, with fervour, “and I know what a
gulch is. My brother is ranching in Wyoming, and I may
join him there in a few months. I believe he also has
interests in Butte.”</p>

<p>“Good! We’ll begin to get friendly right now. So<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[203]</span>
long.” Valdobia returned to his chair, and she asked,
“Is he a brother of your Wyoming friend?”</p>

<p>“He is, and no doubt we’ll go out together. Your
Northwest must be the realest thing left in the world.”</p>

<p>“It’s that, all right. And it will be no end of fun having
you out there!” She smiled sardonically, and Ora
coloured and moved restlessly. She was vaguely aware
of a new drama unfolding, and had no wish to analyse it.</p>

<p>Mowbray, to Ida’s satisfaction, not only deserted his
friends after luncheon, but permitted them to go on to
Rome without him and lingered in Genoa. He was a fair
well set-up young Englishman, with a nonchalant manner
and an inflammable heart. Ida had met him at a country
house and amused herself “landing him,” but as she had
left England immediately after, and hunting had claimed
all his ardours, she neither had seen nor heard from him
since. Although she meant to keep him at her elbow as
long as he served her purpose, she knew him to be a shy
youth under his natural buoyancy and quick intelligence,
and did not disturb her placid mind with visions of
“scenes.” On the whole she liked Englishmen better than
any of the men she had met in Europe, for they had more
pride and self-control where women were concerned; if
things went deeper with them they were less likely to
offend her cold purity with outbursts of passion: which,
she confided to Ora, “made her sick.”</p>

<p>To her delight Valdobia took them one afternoon to call
on an elderly relative who lived in one of the great palaces
of the Via Garibaldi. They were escorted up to the top
floor; the rooms on the other <i>pianos</i> were either closed
or emitted the chill breath of the tomb. Their destination
was a large lofty room, inadequately heated by a stove in
one corner; their noble hostess was fortified against the
cold by several shawls and a foot-warmer. She had invited
three other aristocratic relics in to look at “the Americans,”
and, although the principessa and her friends were
more polite than they would have been to intruding bourgeoises
of their own country, it was apparent that they
could find little to say to two young women from a land
of which they had a confused and wholly contemptuous
apprehension. They knew that its chief title to fame was
its original discovery by a Genoese, that the lower classes
emigrated to it a good deal, and that many American<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[204]</span>
women, who spent far too much money on their clothes,
visited Europe and occasionally married above them.
More than this they neither knew nor cared to know. So
far as they were concerned new countries did not exist.</p>

<p>Conversation languished. Ida was suppressed, and
divided between a desire to laugh and to scream. Ora,
with a heroic effort, talked about the mistake the average
American made in seeing so little of Genoa; but, having
laid aside her furs out of politeness, she was shivering,
and unable to drink the strong coffee which immediately
succumbed to the temperature of the room.</p>

<p>She sent an appealing glance to Valdobia, who was
smiling to himself. Lord John, who had been honoured
by a chair beside his hostess, treated with the consideration
due his ancient lineage, was delivering himself of spasmodic
clauses, with one eye on Valdobia.</p>

<p>“Jimminy!” whispered Ida, who now felt quite at
home with her fellow conspirator, “if you don’t get us
out of this quick I’ll have high-strikes, and Ora’ll get a
cold and be laid up for a week. I always keep her in bed
when she has a cold.”</p>

<p>Valdobia rose instantly. “We have an engagement in
half an hour,” he said to his mother’s second cousin.
“Perhaps you will permit me to show these ladies over the
palace?”</p>

<p>“Oh, do!” exclaimed Mowbray, acting on instinct, for
he was too cold and too unnerved to think. “I’d like
jolly well to see it myself; must be rippin’.”</p>

<p>The permission was given with some graciousness, and
the party bowed themselves out. As they descended the
grand staircase, they heard a buzz of voices behind them,
as of several elderly ladies talking at once.</p>

<p>“We’d be roasting on red-hot coals this minute if there
were any in that refrigerator,” said Ida, “but I don’t
care so long as we are going to see the real part of the
palace.”</p>

<p>An aged major domo showed them through the magnificent
reception rooms, built for entertaining a proud and
gorgeous aristocracy in the days when Genoa was known
throughout Europe as “La Superba.” They were hung
with tapestries or cordova leather, and filled with priceless
pictures, porcelains, enamels, gold and silver ware, and
massive furniture. Valdobia told them dramas sentimental<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[205]</span>
and tragic which had been enacted within the walls of the
historic house. But they had to stamp about to avoid a
chill, and were glad to emerge into the warmer air of even
the narrow street.</p>

<p>“Well,” announced Ida, as they walked rapidly out of
the Via Garibaldi into the broad sunshine of the Piazza
delle Fontane Marose, “if that’s a sample of your ancient
aristocracy no more of it in mine. My curiosity is satisfied
for good and all. Why on earth don’t they live like human
beings?”</p>

<p>“Or steam-heated Americans?” asked Valdobia, smiling.
“Console yourself with the assurance that you are the
only Americans that have ever crossed that threshold.”</p>

<p>“It doesn’t console me one little bit, and I feel pneumonia
coming on. Let’s walk as fast as we know how!”
And accompanied by the willing Englishman she started
off with a stride that soon left the others far behind.</p>

<p>“It is true,” said Valdobia disgustedly, “that this older
generation does not know how to live, not in any sense.
They possess the greatest wealth in Italy, and they hoard
it as if poverty stared them in the face. They have only
to turn on the electric lights once a week and provide a
simple supper to make Genoa one of the most delightful
cities in Europe, but they won’t even do that. They have
the finest jewels in Italy and never wear them except on
the rare occasions when the King and Queen visit Genoa
and command them to the royal palace. Thank heaven
there is a younger set, equally well born, that live in the
new apartment houses or in those villas up on the hills,
and are neither too economical nor too antiquated in their
ideas to enjoy life. Those old people are divided up into
intimate little sets and spend their lives gossipping about
the rest of Genoa or talking of the past. But I do hope
you did not take cold.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t, and I really enjoyed it!” said Ora, smiling
mischievously. “I amused myself thinking what would
happen if I told our uncomfortable hostess that my father’s
sister had married a Roman relative of her husband; but
I wouldn’t have relieved the situation for the world. I
suppose they are fumigating themselves.”</p>

<p>“I don’t doubt it. They think they are aristocratic and
are merely provincial.”</p>

<p>“How different you are!” Ora looked at him admiringly.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[206]</span>
“One hardly could believe that you belonged to
the same race.”</p>

<p>“I don’t. I am a Roman, and a citizen of the world.
No doubt you, too, have a root that runs back into the
dark ages, but today is all that counts with us. I mean
that in more senses than one!” And, although he smiled,
he gave her a quick side-glance.</p>

<p>“I hope so. I am well aware that you are enjoying
yourself immensely.” Ora felt it quite safe to flirt with
him in the open street.</p>

<p>“Do you like me a little better?”</p>

<p>“Rather. Friendly companionship is my chief idea of
happiness, now that I am more or less tired of books.”</p>

<p>“Is it? May it be my good fortune to initiate you into
a higher! You have everything to learn!”</p>

<p>“Have I? I wonder!”</p>

<p>“What do you mean by that? Have you ever been in
love?”</p>

<p>“Not the least little bit!”</p>

<p>“You said that rather too vehemently. It is my turn
to wonder.” This time he looked hard at her and his face
was grim. He had a way of setting his jaw that reminded
her of the man whose haunting memory had made her
alternately happy and miserable during many long months.
She looked away hastily.</p>

<p>“The kind of love you mean I have not the very least
knowledge of. You must believe that.”</p>

<p>“Of what other kind, then?”</p>

<p>“Oh, all women dream, you know,” she said lightly.
“They have a sort of ideal that consoles them for missing
the realities of life. You come quite close to it,” and once
more she sparkled her eyes at him.</p>

<p>“I have no intention of letting you flirt with me,” said
Valdobia calmly. “My flirting days are over. I shall
remain the best of your friends until you love me or send
me to the other end of the world.”</p>

<p>“Well, don’t become serious and spoil everything.”</p>

<p>“I shall not lose my head, if that is what you mean,”
he said drily. “I find the present state of affairs very
pleasant. Let us overtake the others and go for a drive.”</p>

<p class="drop-cap">“WELL,” said Ora, when she and Ida had returned
to the hotel to dress for dinner, “did you have a
queer feeling when you were prowling through those dim
old rooms, furnished three or four hundred years ago, and
the scene of all sorts of romance and tragedy?”</p>

<p>“I had a queer feeling all right. Had visions of rheumatism,
sciatica, pneumonia, and a red nose for a week.
I suppose those wonderful velvet gowns they wore—in
pictures, anyhow—were padded inside, and they slept in
them; didn’t take them off all winter. If I lived in one
of those palaces today I’d surely lose all my good American
habits.”</p>

<p>“Didn’t you have any haunting sense of mystery—of
having been there before?”</p>

<p>“Nixie! No wonder I murdered if I ever was. However,”
she added thoughtfully, “there’s no telling what I
might have felt if they’d had a furnace in the house.
There was something wonderful about it, all right—being
in those musty old rooms, that fairly smelt of the past. I
guess they’ll haunt me as some of those Roman palaces
have that are not shown to the public. But don’t put
weird ideas into my head, Ora. They don’t gee with
Butte. The severely practical is my lay.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you think there could be romance and tragedy
in Butte?”</p>

<p>“Oh, plenty of shooting, if you mean that; and mixing-up.
But people don’t stay jealous long enough to get real
tragic about it; they just get a divorce. We’ve improved
on daggers and poisoned bowls and rings, and the rest of
it. Good old Butte!”</p>

<p>They all dined at the Bristol that night, and soon after
nine o’clock had the smoking-room to themselves. Ida,
indeed, carried Mowbray off into the reading-room. Ora
sighed as she found herself alone with the handsome distinguished
Roman of the type that even in minor exponents<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[208]</span>
so often compelled her response. Why didn’t she love
him? He was proving himself the ideal companion. There
was apparently no question to which he had not given
some thought, and he knew far more about the subjects
that appealed to her than she did herself. They discussed
the ever-fascinating sexual problems impersonally, delicately,
and exhaustively, a feat in itself, an experience
Ora never had enjoyed before; for while it drew them
together it apparently neither disturbed Valdobia nor
altered his attitude toward her. His analyses of politics
and of the fashionable authors of the day were the acutest
she had heard or read, and he enlarged her knowledge of
the world by his anecdotes of life in the different capitals
of Europe that he knew so well. He could be personal
without egotism, and his sense of humour was keener than
her own. While he treated her ideas and criticisms with
deference he forced her to look up to him and to feel only
pleasure in his masterful mind and great experience.</p>

<p>Tonight he made her talk about herself; and, artfully
beating about her life’s most significant chapter, she expressed
herself with a freedom and veracity which she
found another novel and fascinating experience; her confidences
to Ida were superficial and sporadic. She could
feel his sympathy and understanding flow toward her,
although he uttered no sentimental platitudes, and let
only his eyes express a little of what he felt. But for
the hour she glowed with a sense of utter companionship,
her mind was stimulated to the pitch of excitement; she
caught herself wishing that they could have these long
intimate talks for the rest of their lives, and that he would
sometimes hold her hand to complete the sense of perfect
understanding.</p>

<p>When they parted at midnight and she walked slowly
up the stairs alone—Ida had dismissed Mowbray an hour
since—she sighed again. Why didn’t she feel the pull?
What was the nature of that mysterious current that
seemed to vibrate between two people only out of the world’s
billions, and was quite independent of mental identities?
Certainly passion was not the only source. If she had
been free and never had met Gregory Compton she would
have married Valdobia and given him all he craved; for
his magnetism was by no means confined to his brain. Why
could not she love him as it was? She had not been the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[209]</span>
heroine of one of those passionate love affairs that leave
a woman cold for several years, perhaps for ever. The
intensity of emotion she had experienced during these
months in Europe had been one-sided, a mere madness of
the imagination. She had yet to realise that a woman can
live more profoundly and completely with a man in her
imagination than when in daily contact with his discouraging
weaknesses, his inability to reach her impossible standard,
and impinged upon by the disintegrating forces of
daily life.</p>

<p>Such women as Ora Blake, endowed with a certain measure
of creative imagination, yet spending their maturing
years unnaturalised citizens in a cross-section of life which
barely brushes their aloofness in passing, develop as unnormally
as those that cultivate this exotic garden of the
mind for fame and fortune. If they find a mate while the
imagination is still as young as their years, these highly
organised women, with every sense and faculty keenly
alert, and stimulated by mental contact as others may be
by drugs and wine, have the opportunity at least to be the
happiest beings on earth. If they marry a brute, or are
forced to fight the world for bread, a wide channel is dug
in the brain through which flow the normal and crowding
thoughts of the average, commonplace, adaptable woman;
which is perhaps the best of all educations for life.</p>

<p>But Ora had married a kind prosaic man who soon
learned to let her alone, and kept her in a comfort that
burdened her days with leisure. If she had been unimaginative
no harm would have been done. She either
would have grown fond of her essential husband and become
a domestic angel, or consoled herself with society and
bridge. But, misplaced in life, she belonged to the intellectual
aristocracy of the earth, who are the loneliest of
its inhabitants, unless they can establish an invisible bond
with their fellow-beings by offerings from that mental
garden which is at once their curse and their compensation
for the doubtful gift of life.</p>

<p>Ora was too indifferent to the world to care to weave
this gossamer bridge, and had grown accustomed to mental
solitude. But she had never placed any curb on her imagination.
In the days when her only solace was books it
enabled her to visualise the <i>mise-en-scène</i> of the remote or
immediate past, the procession of the traveller, or the abstractions<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[210]</span>
of science; as if she were in one of those theatres
where the great modern manager threatens to atrophy
what imagination is left in the world. It even enabled her
to enjoy fiction whose scene was a land of which she had
no personal knowledge; a rare gift in the American, whose
demand for familiar settings and characters keeps our
literature commonplace. And she could at will shut her
eyes and wander in Europe when Butte became insufferable.</p>

<p>Her surrender to the obsession of Gregory Compton had
been gradual; she had fought it, not only out of loyalty
to her husband and her friend, but because the future
menaced terrors against which she had no desire to pit
her strength. But she had finally cast defiance to the
future, and dismissed her phantom loyalty with a shrug.
Mark no doubt had consoled himself for her defection
long since; to Ida a husband was a money-maker pure and
simple. She herself would never see Gregory Compton
again if she could avoid it; or, if life took her inevitably
back to Butte, no doubt her infatuation would have been
cured by mental satiety, and she would be able to greet him
with the indifference that is ever the portion of the discarded
lover.</p>

<p>Having arrived at this reasonable conclusion, she had
dismissed cynicism, cowardice, and qualms, to limbo, and
entered upon one of those exalting, tormenting, incredibly
sweet, and profoundly depressing mental love affairs,
which, lacking the element of comedy inevitable in all
actual relations between men and women, obsess the mind
and detach it from life.</p>

<p>After she parted from Valdobia, puzzled and wistful,
she recalled one week during which she had been completely
happy. Ida was visiting friends uncongenial to
herself, and she had gone alone to Bruges. In that ancient
city of almost perfect beauty, she had given the wildness
in her nature uninterrupted liberty. She had written
letters that no woman yet has sent to a man without regretting
it, for in this stage of man’s progress, at least,
he wants little of the soul of woman. It is possible that
the women who live in their imaginations are the most
fortunate, after all, for they arbitrarily make man the
perfect mate he possibly may be some centuries hence. At
all events Ora imagined Gregory Compton with her unremittingly,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[211]</span>
deliberately ignoring the depression that must
descend upon her when once more companioned by his wife.
It had seemed to her that her step had never been so
buoyant, her body so light. People had paused to stare
at the beautiful young American with her head in the air
looking as if she were about to sing. It had been a wonderful,
an almost incredible experience, and she never had
been able quite to recapture it even when alone in the
night. But she had wondered sometimes if life held any
happiness as real as that had been, and she wondered
again as she switched off her light and flung herself into
the bed that had witnessed so much despair before Valdobia
had appeared and put a quietus on her imagination.
She wondered also if the passion of the soul were so much
greater than the common experience of man and woman
that its indulgence must forever make life itself unreal.
She felt that this question threw some light on her problem,
then dismissed the subject peremptorily. She might
regret that extraordinary love affair, with its terrors and
its delights, but she would bury it once for all; and she
fell asleep with the wise remark:</p>

<p>“What fools we are! Oh, lord, what fools!”</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[212]</span>

<h3 class="nobreak">XXXVI</h3>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap2">AFTER this she discarded what was left of her crust,
and emerged like a butterfly. The present was delightful,
she would enjoy it without analysis or retrospect.
She met several clever and interesting men, but had eyes
for no one but Valdobia. They explored Genoa until they
knew it almost as well as the natives, spending hours down
in the long twisted streets, so narrow that no vehicle had
ever visited them, and swarming like the inside of an anthill.
Harrowing adventures were impossible, for the
Genoese masses if discourteous are neither a lawless nor
an impertinent race. Ora and Ida might have roamed
alone, and been unmolested save by the enterprising shopkeepers
that dealt in filigree. They rode over the steep
hills in the trams, and took long motor drives in the brilliant
winter sunshine to the picturesque towns and villages
down the Riviera. Then, on a Saturday morning,
they bade good-bye to the ancient city and took the train
for Monte Carlo.</p>

<p>The girls established themselves in a small hotel opposite
the Casino Gardens, the men in the great hotel that lies
between the Casino and the International Sporting Club.</p>

<p>“I suppose we really should have sent for Lady Gower,”
said Ora, doubtfully, as they hooked each other up for
dinner. “It’s stretching the point rather to come to a
place like Monte Carlo with two men. We’ll be sure to
run into a dozen people we know.”</p>

<p>“Oh, bother! I love the idea of feeling real devilish for
once. Besides, anything goes at Monte Carlo, and everybody
is interested in gambling and nothing else. What
good would old Norfolk-Howard do us, anyhow, asleep on
a sofa. She never could keep awake after ten, and nobody’d
know in those big rooms whether she was there or
not. We’re Americans, anyhow, and I’m having the time
of my life. Lord John is a perfect dear.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[213]</span>“Well, at least I am thankful that you are no longer in
a hurry to return to Butte.”</p>

<p>“Butte’ll keep, I guess. The more experiences I take
back the more they’ll think of me. Gives me backbone to
feel a real woman-of-the-world. Besides, kid, it’s good philosophy
to drink the passing moment dry. Amalgamated
may bust us any minute. You look prettier every day,
and I’m not going off either.”</p>

<p>She wore a severely cut gown of black velvet, the corsage
draped with coral-coloured chiffon. Her first evening
gowns, cut by the ruthless Parisian, had caused her many
qualms but they had been growing more <i>décolleté</i> ever
since; and so superb were her neck and shoulders that she
had ceased to regret her lack of jewels. Ora had refrained
from buying any, although she longed for sapphires; but
she always wore her pearls. Tonight her gown was of a
misty pale green material from which she rose like a lily
from its calyx. She still wore her hair massed softly on
the top of her head, and although not as tall as Ida, and
far from being as fully developed, was an equally arresting
figure. No two women were ever more excellent foils, and
that may have been one secret of their amicable relations.</p>

<p>They dined with their cavaliers at one of the fashionable
restaurants, then, after an hour in the Casino rooms, which
were not at all to their taste, with their ornate walls and
dingy crowd, went by means of lifts and underground
corridors over to the International Sporting Club. Valdobia
and Mowbray had put them up at this exclusive
resort during the afternoon and they entered the roulette
rooms at once. Here the walls were chastely hung with
pale grey satin, and all the colour was in the company.
The long tables were crowded with smart-looking men and
women of both worlds, although only the ladies that had
stepped down from ancestral halls dared to show a grey
hair or a wrinkle. The cocottes were so young and fresh
as well as beautiful that to Ora and Ida they looked much
like girls of their own class. All, young and old, were
splendidly dressed and bejewelled; and if there was excitement
in their brains there was no evidence of it in
their calm or animated faces. They might have been a
great house-party amusing themselves with some new and
innocuous game.</p>

<p>Our party walked about for a time dividing their attention<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[214]</span>
between the spinning balls, the faces of the players,
and the gowns of the women; even those of the cocottes
were not eccentric, although worn with a certain inimitable
style. Their ropes of pearls were also the longest in the
room. A number of the most notable men in Europe
were present, princes of reigning houses, and statesmen
high in the service of their country.</p>

<p>In spite of the absence of that feverish excitement which
is supposed to pervade these gambling rooms of Monte
Carlo (and which is absent from the Casino even when a
man shoots himself and is whisked out), Ora wandered
about in a curious state of exaltation. The cool splendour
of the rooms, the atmosphere of high breeding and restraint,
the gratification of the æsthetic sense at every turn,
the beauty of the women and the distinguished appearance
of the men made it a romantic and memorable scene. Notwithstanding
the constant clink of gold, the monotonous
admonitions of the croupiers, it was a sort of worldly fairyland,
this apotheosis of one of the most perilous of human
indulgences. These people might be gambling for greed
or mere excitement, being blasé of other mundane diversions,
but they were at the same time so frank and so reserved,
so pleased and so indifferent, that they produced
the illusion of sojourning on a plane high above the common
mortal with his commonplace loves and disasters and
struggles to exist or shine. No wonder that men came
here to forget the burdens of state, women Society’s conservatisms
or the inconstancy of man. For the hour, and
the hour generally lasted until four in the morning, they
lived in a world apart, and a duchess sat next to a cocotte
with a serene indifference that amounted almost to
democracy.</p>

<p>“I don’t know that romantic is the word I should use,”
said Valdobia, laughing; Ora had uttered some of her
thoughts aloud; “but I think I know what you mean. The
people that come here can afford to lose; their minds are
almost as carefully composed as their costumes; they are
both pleasantly reckless and frivolous; this is their real
play-time; the world beyond these four walls is obliterated;
if they lose they shrug their shoulders, and if they win
they experience something like a real thrill; in short, being
soaked in worldliness, it is their only chance to feel primitive—for
gambling was practised by the most ancient<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[215]</span>
tribes of which we have any knowledge. At the Casino
most of those people are subconsciously wondering how
they are going to pay their hotel bills and get out of
Monte Carlo, calm as they manage to look; but here—well,
here you see the quintessence of the world’s frivolity. No
wonder it creates a heady atmosphere. Do you want to
gamble?”</p>

<p>“Of course I do.”</p>

<p>“Well, put a louis on the red. I’ll follow your stakes.
Perhaps we’ll bring each other luck.”</p>

<p>They staked and won, staked and won again, seven
times running without removing their winnings from the
red. Then Valdobia said, “Don’t tempt fortune too far.
The luck may turn to the green any moment. Suppose
we try ours <i>en plein</i>.” He selected the number 39, and
once more they won. Ora, her hands full of gold, turned
to him with blazing eyes. Her cheeks were crimson. Valdobia
laughed.</p>

<p>“You mustn’t look so happy,” he said teasingly,
“or these old stagers will know that you are what your
friend calls a hayseed. Better change all this gold into
notes.”</p>

<p>“Notes? I want my gold. Paper never did mean anything
to me.”</p>

<p>“What a child you are—ah! I must leave you for a
moment. The Duc——” he mentioned a prince of his
royal house—“wishes to speak to me. Don’t try <i>en plein</i>
again. That rarely happens twice. Put a louis at a time
on the red.”</p>

<p>He left her. Ora deliberately placed not only her double
handful of gold on the red, but pushed forward the pile
that had accumulated before her. Red came up and
doubled her winnings. She added to her already imposing
hillock the gold shoved toward her, and, with a quick
glance at Valdobia, who was deep in conversation with
his prince, took a thousand franc note from her châtelaine
bag and laid it on top of the gold. Once more she won,
and met the sympathetic smiles of the croupiers, who in
the Sporting Club, at least, are very human persons. She
was about to add another thousand franc note, when Valdobia
returned. He swept her gold and notes off the red
just as <i>rien ne va plus</i> sounded above the buzz of conversation
behind the tables.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[216]</span>“What on earth are you doing?” he asked angrily. “I
don’t like to see a woman gamble like that.”</p>

<p>Ora pouted and looked like a naughty child.</p>

<p>“But I want to gamble. Give me my money. What
have you to say about it?”</p>

<p>“I brought you here—and I shall not bring you again
if you are going to gamble like that old Frankfurt banker
over there. Why not follow the example of Mrs. Compton,
who is decorously putting five franc pieces on the green
at the next table?”</p>

<p>“Oh, Ida! I like the sensation of doing big things.
You just said we enjoyed letting loose our primitive instincts.”</p>

<p>“Is that the way you felt? Well, here are three louis.
Stake one at a time. I shall change the rest into notes
and give them to you at the hotel.”</p>

<p>He kept his eye on her, and she staked her gold pieces one
after another and lost.</p>

<p>“Now,” he said, “come into the bar and have a glass of
wine or a lemon squash. I want to talk to you.”</p>

<p>They found seats in a corner of the bar behind a little
table, and Ora demurely ordered a lemonade. “I suppose
you are going to scold me,” she murmured, although her
cheeks were still flushed and her eyes rebellious. “What
difference did it make? I am not poor, and I had won
nearly all that I risked, anyhow. You have seen women
gamble all your life. One would think that you were a
hayseed, yourself.”</p>

<p>“Shall I be quite honest? I fancy I was jealous. For
the first time I saw you completely carried away. I had
hoped to furnish that impulse myself!”</p>

<p>“It is a wonderful sensation,” she said provokingly.
“I doubt if anything but gambling could inspire it.”</p>

<p>“Do you?” But he knew that it was no time for sentiment,
and asked curiously, “Are you so fond of gold? I
never saw such a greedy little thing.”</p>

<p>“Remember I’ve walked round over gold for the best
part of my life, and have a mine of my own. It fascinates
me, but not because I care much about riches—I like the
liberty that plenty of money gives; that, to my mind, is all
that wealth means. But I loved the feeling of being possessed,
of being absolutely reckless. I should have liked
to know that my whole fortune depended upon that spinning<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[217]</span>
ball. That would have been worth while! It makes
one forget everything—everything!”</p>

<p>He looked at her with half-closed eyes. “You have a
secret chapter in your life,” he said. “Some day I shall
read it. But I can’t make up my mind whether you are a
born gambler or not.”</p>

<p>Ora shrugged her shoulders. “To tell you the truth I
shouldn’t care if I never saw a gambling table again. I
have had the sensation. That is enough. I will admit I
was rather disappointed not to lose that immense stake.
Lucky at cards, you know.”</p>

<p>“And you think you are unlucky in love?” Valdobia
laughed, but his face was still grim. “How many men
have you had in love with you already?”</p>

<p>“That doesn’t count!”</p>

<p>He turned pale. “What do you mean by that?”</p>

<p>“I mean that I don’t believe I am destined to happiness.
Don’t you think we know our lines instinctively?”</p>

<p>“I know that you are trying to torment me. You are
still excited and angry, so I shall not permit your words,
significant as they are, to keep me awake tonight.” He
was smiling again, but she saw the anger in his own eyes,
and said impulsively:</p>

<p>“I rather like you better than usual tonight. You have
made me do something I didn’t want to do, and anger is
becoming to you.”</p>

<p>“The eternal female! Well, God knows, I wouldn’t
have you abnormal. What is this?”</p>

<p>A page was standing before the table with a telegram in
his hand. “Pour M. le Marquis de Valdobia,” he said.</p>

<p>With a word of apology Valdobia opened the telegram.
Ora, watching him, saw his face turn white.</p>

<p>“What is it?” she asked anxiously. “I do hope it is
not bad news.” She felt a sharp pang at the possibility
of losing him.</p>

<p>He rose and looked at his watch. “My mother is very
ill,” he said. “A train goes in an hour and ten minutes.
I must take it. But there is something I want to say to you
before I go; I may be detained in Rome. Will you get
your wrap and come into the gardens for a few moments?”</p>

<p>“I am so sorry,” murmured Ora, with real sympathy.
“Of course I will go.”</p>

<p>He took her to the cloak-room. “Wait here for a moment,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[218]</span>
he said. “I must telephone to my man to pack and
meet me at the train; and tell Mowbray not to look for us
later.”</p>

<p>He left her, and Ora watched the passing couples, trying
not to think. She was a little frightened, but still too
excited to shrink from a possible ordeal.</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap">HE returned in a few moments, and they left the Club
House by the main entrance and strolled toward
the gardens; then he suddenly led her to the terrace.
There were many people walking in the tropical scented
park of the Casino, but the digue above the Mediterranean
was deserted. Monte Carlo can be cold in May but it can
be as warm as July in February, and the night was mild
and beautiful. The sea under the stars was almost as
blue as by day. The air was very still, although a band
was playing somewhere, far away. From the other side
of the bay came the faint humming of an aeroplane. There
was to be an aviation meet on the morrow, and no doubt
one of the airmen was about to make a trial flight.</p>

<p>They sat down on one of the benches, and Valdobia
folded his arms, then turned and leaned his elbow on the
back of the seat and his head on his hand.</p>

<p>“I am not quite in the mood for love-making,” he said,
“after the news I have received; but I can’t go without
letting you know why I followed you to Genoa—without
some sort of an understanding.”</p>

<p>Ora looked at him out of the corner of her eye. His
face was set and determined, but she concluded that he
was not the man to be dangerous when grieving for his
mother.</p>

<p>“What is it?” she asked softly. “I know, of course, that
you—like me.”</p>

<p>“I love you, and I want to marry you. I wish you to
divorce your husband and marry me. Don’t give me your
final answer now,” he continued, as Ora interrupted him.
“It is not a question to decide in a moment. But while I
am gone think it over. You do not love your husband.
I know all your arguments from your friend. She made
them when I first gave her my confidence. They don’t
weigh with me for a moment. You will never spend your
life with that man, good as he may be. As for obligations,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[220]</span>
you discharged them long ago. I can make you
happy, and I believe that you know I can.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know.” Ora, stunned for a moment, felt
thrilled and breathless. “Oh, I don’t know!”</p>

<p>“I have begun to feel sure that you have loved another
man, or fancied that you loved him. Would it be possible
for you to marry him if you divorced your husband?”</p>

<p>Ora hesitated, then answered, “No.”</p>

<p>“Why is he not your lover?”</p>

<p>“That would be impossible, even if I would do such a
thing, and you know I would not.”</p>

<p>He gave a sharp sigh of relief. “I <i>felt</i> that he had not
been. Why is it impossible?”</p>

<p>“There are complications. I cannot explain them. But
he could not be less to me if he were dead.”</p>

<p>“Does he love you?”</p>

<p>Ora hesitated again. “I have sometimes felt—no, of
course, it is impossible. I let my imagination run away
with me, that was all.”</p>

<p>“You mean that he never told you—that he doesn’t
write to you?”</p>

<p>“I met him only once, and I have never seen his handwriting.”</p>

<p>“Well, dismiss him from your mind. You have imagination
and have dreamed, because your demands upon life
are very great, greater than you know; and oddly enough,
considering your opportunities, fruition has eluded you.
But the time has come for you to live; and you could
live!”</p>

<p>Ora looked down at her hands. They were ungloved
and looked very white and small. Valdobia suddenly covered
them with one of his own, and bent his face close to
hers. She saw that he had forgotten his mother, and gave
a little gasp.</p>

<p>“Ora!” he said. “Don’t you know how happy I could
make you? I not only could teach you love, of which you
know nothing, but we could always be companions, and
you are the loneliest little creature I have ever met.”</p>

<p>To her astonishment she saw two tears splash on his
hand, and winking rapidly discovered that they had fallen
from her own eyes. As she would have detested to see a
man cry, she melted further, and whispered,</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, life with you would be very delightful. I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[221]</span>
know that. I fancy the other man, even if I could marry
him, would make me miserable. He—American men that
amount to anything give their wives very little of themselves.”</p>

<p>“And you would be lonelier still! I have known American
women that loved their busy husbands—that <i>seeking</i>
type. They interested me, poor things—rushing madly
about trying to fill their lives. If you join that sisterhood
it will kill you. I am not an idler, for I have business
interests to which I devote a certain amount of time, but
I have leisure, and I not only should give you the companionship
you have craved all your life, but I can offer
you the world in all its variety. Now dismiss this man,
whoever he is, from your mind. Even were I beside the
question, it is your duty to yourself as a woman of character,
not a sentimental schoolgirl.”</p>

<p>“Yes, that is true.”</p>

<p>“That sort of thing is morbid, besides being quite beneath
a woman of pride and dignity. But women often
romance about some dream-hero until they have found the
right man. Can you doubt that I am the man for you?
You were made for Europe, not for America, and for a
man that can give you everything—everything!”</p>

<p>“Yes, I know.” She moved restlessly. “If I could
only feel just one thing more for you! I hardly know
what to call it—I like you better than anyone in the
world. I almost love you. Why don’t I?” Her voice was
suddenly full of passion and she clasped both of her hands
about his own. “If you could only make me, I should
worship you.”</p>

<p>He glanced about rapidly. They were quite alone. He
put his arm round her and she felt it vibrate. His face
was flushed and his breath short. She could feel his heart
thumping against her head, and she was fascinated for
more reasons than one: she knew that it was many years
since any woman had roused him to strong emotion, and
it was the first great passion that had ever been close to
her save in her stormy imagination. She was enthralled
for a moment, and some of the wildness in her own nature
stirred. But it was too soon, she must have time to think.
She cast about desperately and found her inspiration.</p>

<p>“We have been here a long time!” she said hurriedly.
“You will miss your train. Your mother may be very ill.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[222]</span>He dropped his arm, and stood up.</p>

<p>“You are a woman of infinite resource,” he said. “And
no little cruelty. Will you consider what I have asked
you—seriously?”</p>

<p>His anger as well as his power to control himself always
fascinated her, and she also experienced a spasm of contrition.
She rose and gave him her hand; her eyes were
frank and kind.</p>

<p>“Yes,” she said. “I will consider it, and think of you
always—and miss you horribly. Will you telegraph to
me every day?”</p>

<p>“Two or three times a day, probably. And don’t think
I am really angry with you. If you are cruel it is only
because you don’t understand. I am glad that you do not,
for it is only women that have loved greatly that have
forgotten how to be cruel. Come. I must take you to
your hotel.”</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">I</h3>

<p class="drop-cap">TWO weeks later Ora and Ida sailed from Havre. Gregory
had cabled, and the <i>Herald</i> had published a
dramatic account, of the wounding of Mr. Mark Blake in
the tunnel of his wife’s mine. The engineers’ lease had
expired and he had closed down the mine temporarily.
The sinking of the inclined shaft in the “Apex” had proceeded
very slowly owing to the uncommon hardness of the
rock; it would seem that Nature herself had taken a hand
in the great fight and enlisted for once on the side of the
weaker power. Although when Osborne and Douglas had
turned over the mine, their cross-cut almost had reached
the point on the vein which the new shaft expected to
strike, Gregory had risen twice in the night and walked
along the hill beyond his boundary, reasonably sure that
all the blasting was not in the shaft, his keen ear detecting
muffled reverberations slightly to the east and at a greater
depth. He communicated his suspicions to Mark, and
on the following night they examined the lock on the
Primo shaft house and discovered that it had been tampered
with. They went down by way of the ladder; and
in the cross-cut on the chalcopyrite vein they found miners
working with hand drills. There was a desperate
hand-to-hand fight with the manager and shift boss; the
miners, who were bohunks, proceeding phlegmatically with
their work.</p>

<p>The four men had wrestled out into the station at the
foot of the shaft, where they had drawn their “guns”;
each had been wounded, but only Mark seriously. He had
received a ball in the lung and another in the leg. The
night was bitterly cold and it was some time before Gregory
and the two antagonists could get him to the surface. He
had insisted upon being taken to a hospital in Butte; and,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[226]</span>
between loss of blood, shock, and pneumonia, his condition
was precarious.</p>

<p>The girls, who had left Monte Carlo two days after
Valdobia’s sudden departure, received the news in Paris,
where they were replenishing their wardrobes. Ora, torn
with remorse, and terrified with vague and tragic visions
of the future, was in a distracted condition; but Ida, although
she sincerely lamented the possible demise of her
old friend, did not lose her head. She gave final and
minute orders to tailors and dressmakers, instructed them
to send the trousseaux in bond directly to Great Falls, Montana,
devoted a morning to the selection of hats both for
herself and her friend, and packed all the trunks. Mowbray,
always willing to be useful, bought their tickets and
escorted them to Havre. Ida thanked him with something
like real warmth as they parted at the head of the gangplank,
and promised him the “time of his life” when he
came to Montana in the summer.</p>

<p>“Now, buck up,” she said, smiling into his disconsolate
face; “you know I’m not flirting with you. We’re
the best of pals. I’ll be glad to see you, all right, and
perhaps I’ll find a nice little heiress for you.”</p>

<p>“Oh, don’t!” Mowbray tried to arrange his features
for the benefit of the passersby. “You know I’m fond
of you no end. Why——”</p>

<p>“Get along now. That’s the last whistle. Good-bye, and
write me nice gossippy letters. It’s only a few months,
anyhow.”</p>

<p>Mowbray walked down the gangplank with his head in
the air, and, as he turned on the dock to lift his hat, Ida
noticed that his face, whose charm was its boyish gayety,
looked suddenly older, and almost as determined as Valdobia’s.</p>

<p>“Oh, Lord!” she thought, as she turned away, “men!
They’re as alike as lead pencils in a box. But I guess I
can manage him.”</p>

<p>Ora stayed in bed for two days; reaction left her physically
exhausted and she slept most of the time. On the
third day Ida peremptorily dressed her and took her on
deck. A wireless from Gregory, announcing that Mark
was holding his own, further revived her, and before they
reached New York another wireless was still more reassuring.
A few years before, when the ores of Butte Hill were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[227]</span>
roasted in the open and the poisonous fumes were often
as thick as the worst of London fogs, pneumonia ran its
course in twenty-four hours to the grave, but in these days
the patient had a fighting chance despite the altitude. The
Butte doctors were experts in pneumonia, so many of the
careless miners were afflicted, and Mark not only had a
sound constitution but never had been a heavy drinker.
There was every reason to expect him to pull through, as
Ida assured her friend whenever they were alone; but she
managed to meet several agreeable people, and kept herself
and Ora companioned by them throughout the voyage.</p>

<p>Valdobia was still in Rome; his mother was dying. He
had written daily to Ora and she had read and reread
his letters. They said neither too much nor too little; but
he was one of life’s artists and he managed to pervade
them with an atmosphere that was both sweet and disturbing.
His telegram, when he had read the news of her
husband’s misadventure in the newspapers, was a masterpiece.
If he was unable to grieve over the possibility of
Mr. Blake’s abrupt removal from a scene where he was
the one superfluous actor, too well-bred to betray his relief,
and too little of a hypocrite to be verbose in condolence,
his attitude was so finely impersonal, and it was so obvious
that he knew exactly how she felt, that Ora liked him
more than ever if only for rousing her stricken sense of
humour.</p>

<p>She had thrust his letters and telegrams into the depths
of her steamer trunk, but after she had made up her mind
that Mark would recover (her lively imagination picturing
him hobbling among the orange groves of Southern California
while she guided his footsteps and diverted his
mind), she retrieved the correspondence and read it every
night when alone in her stateroom. Valdobia’s devotion
not only gave her courage, but his strong imposing personality
stood with a haughty and confident menace between
herself and Gregory Compton. She refused to
think on her future, beyond the long convalescence of her
husband, but had it not been for her meeting with Valdobia
and her deliberate installment of his image on the
throne of her adventurous imagination, she doubted if she
would have had the courage to return to Montana. As it
was there were moments when the poignant mental life she
had led with Gregory Compton reached a long finger from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[228]</span>
the depths to which it had been consigned and sketched
his image in her mind as vividly as if he stood before her;
while her whole being ached with longing and despair.
But her will was strong; she banished him summarily
and reinstated the Roman who was so like and so unlike the
man compounded of the old world and the new in the
mortar of the Northwest.</p>

<p>Ida, with an unexpected delicacy, refrained from curiosity,
and although she had too much tact to avoid all mention
of Valdobia, only alluded to him casually. She left
Europe out of the conversation as much as possible, and
amused Ora, when they were alone, with the plans of her
campaign in Butte. When they reached quarantine Ora
was horrified to find herself surrounded by reporters. The
Paris <i>Herald</i> had published the story of her mine as well
as her picture and Ida’s, but they hardly had been sensible
of their notoriety until, on the steamer, they were among
Americans once more. It was manifest that they were
“big news” in their own country, and Ora fled to her
stateroom, leaving Ida to face the reporters alone.</p>

<p>Ida was undaunted; moreover she was quick to seize
her first opportunity to dazzle Butte. She made herself
amiable and interesting to the young men, her natural
cunning steering her mid-stream, in this her first interview:
an ordeal in which most novices are wrecked on the
tropic or the arctic shore. She thanked them as warmly
for their news that Mr. Blake had left that morning with
his doctors and nurses in a private car for Southern California,
and expected his wife to go directly to Los Angeles,
as if Ora had not received a wireless to that effect an hour
before; she modestly told them something of her social
experiences abroad, answered the inevitable questions regarding
suffrage, excused Ora, “who was naturally upset”,
and expatiated upon her happiness in returning to
live in Butte. They thought this odd, but were so delighted
with her mixture of dignity and naïveté that they rushed
to their respective desks and told the world that the wife
of Gregory Compton had been the guest of princes and
was the handsomest woman in America.</p>

<p>Ora was almost gay at the prospect of going directly to
California, although she was obliged to make the journey
alone. It was early in the afternoon when they landed.
Ida established Ora in the first Overland Limited that left<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[229]</span>
the Grand Central Station, and returned to the Waldorf-Astoria,
where she had engaged rooms for a month. She
had no intention of returning to Butte ignorant of New
York. Westerners of wealth, old and recent, visited New
York casually several times a year; and not to know it,
even with Europe to her credit, stamped a woman with
the newness of the new-rich who wore all their jewels all
the time. Ida had seen many women make fools of themselves
and had no intention of leaving any penetrable
spaces in her armour. She spent every morning in the
shops, or in the establishments of the exclusive dressmakers,
tailors and milliners that were patronized by the fashionable
women of Butte and Helena, giving them liberal
orders. She saw all the new plays, heard the more famous
of the opera singers, and even attended three symphony
concerts. She drove in the Park every afternoon or joined
the throngs on Fifth Avenue; and she took tea or lunch in
the different hotels and restaurants devoted to fashion.
Sometimes she sat in the gangways of her own famous
hostellerie, recalling with a tolerant smile her early crude
ambitions—had they died less than a year ago?—to trail
her feathers up and down Peacock Alley. She wore one
of her severest tailored suits upon these occasions, and
maintained an air of stately detachment that somewhat
counteracted the always startling beauty of her face and
figure. No man took his courage in his hand.</p>

<p>One afternoon she sat longer than usual, for she had set
her teeth that day and walked through the Metropolitan
Museum. She fell to musing, and with a more sustained
introspection than was her habit, upon the changes that
had taken place within herself during the past year; wondering
“how deep they had struck”, if she really were as
altered as she must appear even to the raking eye of
Butte; or if she merely had developed her native characteristics
while polishing her surface and furnishing her
mind.</p>

<p>She also endeavoured to analyse her attitude toward
returning to her husband, but gave this up, although puzzled
that it was not more obvious. But her mind was clear
on one point. If Gregory desired her society he must spend
his week-ends in Butte; nothing would induce her to return
to the De Smet ranch. She had not even a spasm of
curiosity to see the famous Perch of the Devil Mine.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">II</h3>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">IDA was not given to imaginative excursions, but during
the three days’ journey from New York to Butte, she
made no acquaintances, resting in the seclusion of her drawing-room;
and after she had read all the magazines her
mind began to people itself. Although the ladies of Butte,
whom she now regarded as equals, moved along the central
highway, Gregory was always turning the corners, and
she visualised him most frequently advancing hurriedly
toward the station as the train entered—both late, of
course. She rehearsed the meeting many times, never
without a pricking sense of awkwardness, for she now fully
realised that when a woman and her husband have not
communicated save on the wire for nearly a year, the first
interview is liable to constraint. He always had been difficult
to talk to. Would he be bored if she tried to entertain
him as Ora would entertain Mark: with such excerpts
of their many experiences as a confiding husband
might appreciate? She never had understood him. Out
of her greater knowledge of the world and men should she
be better able to fathom the reserves of that strange silent
nature—or did she really care whether she could or not?
Although she had made up her mind to greet him at the
station with the warmth of an old friend, and flatter him
with her delight in returning home, she had not the faintest
idea how she should carry off the long evening—if the
train were on time.</p>

<p>It was not. Probably no Northwestern train has arrived
on time in the history of the three railroads. Ida’s train,
due at seven in the evening, arrived at midnight. Her
Pullman was at the end of the long dark platform, and
as she walked slowly toward the station building—which
looked like the bunk-house of an abandoned mining
camp in the desert—searching for someone to carry her
hand baggage—porters being non-existent in the Northwest—she
saw neither Gregory nor any other familiar face.
For the first time in her life she felt a disposition to cry.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[231]</span>
But as she tossed her head higher and set her lips, a young
man approached and asked if she were Mrs. Gregory
Compton. He was a pleasant looking youth, and she was
so grateful to be called by name that she forgot her new
reserve and replied emphatically that she was.</p>

<p>“I am your chauffeur,” he said. “Your new car arrived
a few days ago, and Mr. Compton ’phoned me to meet
you. Have you any hand baggage?”</p>

<p>Ida indicated her portmanteau and hat box in the dark
perspective and went on to inspect her car. It was a handsome
limousine, lighted with electricity, and for a moment
she took a childish pleasure in examining its fittings.
But as the man returned and piled her baggage in front
she asked irrepressibly:</p>

<p>“Is Mr. Compton not in Butte?”</p>

<p>“No, ma’am. He hasn’t been in Butte for weeks. Lively
times out at the mine, I guess.”</p>

<p>“And my house? Had I not better go to a hotel?”</p>

<p>“Oh, the house is all right. Mr. Compton’s secretary
’phoned to an agency, and they put in three or four in help.
I guess you’ll find everything all right.”</p>

<p>Ida entered her car, but scowled at its luxuries. By
this time she was “mad clean through.” “The famous
American husband!” she thought, gritting her teeth.
“Best in the world—not. If it’s my horse, my dog, my
wife with an Englishman, it’s business first last and always
with an American. European men are courteous
whether they mean it or not, but Americans only remember
to be polite when they have time. Ten months and he can’t
leave his mine long enough to meet me when I arrive at
midnight!”</p>

<p>Her pleasure in returning to Butte had turned as flat
as spilt champagne. She did not even glance at the gay
electric signs and midnight activities of Broadway as her
car rolled through that sleepless thoroughfare toward the
West Side. But when her chauffeur, who had ignored
the speed limit, stopped abruptly before a large house of
admirable architecture and blazing with lights, her face
flushed with excitement and she forgot her recalcitrant
spouse. The door was opened at once and two maid servants
ran down the steps. They were young, neatly dressed and
capped, and it was evident that their service was dictated
not only by curiosity but by sympathy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[232]</span>“Welcome home, ma’am,” one of them, a Swede, said
shyly as Ida stepped to the pavement. “It’s too bad your
train was so late. The cook’s got a nice hot supper for
you.”</p>

<p>Ida, who was not easily touched, felt as grateful to these
smiling girls as to her friendly chauffeur, and for a moment
was tempted to “come down off her perch” and revel
in human companionship. But she knew that it “wouldn’t
work”; she merely thanked them graciously and ascended
the wide steps of her new home, that palatial residence of
cream-colored pressed brick of her unswerving desires.
While the maids were taking her bags and boxes upstairs,
she walked through the large rooms of the lower floor.
Everything was in the best modern style of furnishing, the
prevailing tone dim and rich, with Eastern rugs on the
hardwood floors; French tapestries and carved oak furniture
and stained glass in the library—also a few books;
paler tapestries set in panels in the immense drawing-room,
and many beautiful pieces of furniture carefully
selected with an eye to both contrast and mating. Out of
this room opened a dining-room that looked like a baronial
hall, and although the Murphys had taken their silverware
they had left their china, imported from Limoges, and
their glass ware, made for them by a Venetian firm that
had supplied Ida’s grandes dames for thirty years. In
short it was one of those stately and sumptuous interiors,
furnished by the best houses in New York, which one associates
exclusively with the three or four great cities of
the United States, and is always unwarrantably surprised
to find in the newer cities of the West.</p>

<p>Ida made a pretence of eating her dainty supper, remembered
that she was now a grande dame and visited
the kitchen to say an appreciative word to the cook, then
ascended to her bedroom divided between anger and a
depression so foreign to her temperament that she barely
recognised it for what it was.</p>

<p>The large upper hall had been fitted up as a billiard
room, and with a continuous divan broken only by the
doors of the bedrooms. Ida threw it an appreciative glance,
but it merely emphasised the fact that there was no man in
the house, and she did not linger. Mrs. Murphy, evidently
a brunette, had furnished her bedroom and dressing-room
in primrose yellow and much lace. Ida approved both as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[233]</span>
unreservedly as she had the rest of the house, thankful
there was nothing to alter; like many women she had consummate
taste in dress and none whatever for house decoration;
although unlike most of these disparate ladies she was
quite aware of her deficiencies. She knew when a room
was all that it should be, but could not have conceived
one of the details, much less the unimpeachable combination.
The sex instinct teaches those subtleties of personal
adornment likely to allure the male, and arrest the anxious
eye of other females, but ancestral brain-cells are necessary
for the more civilised accomplishment.</p>

<p>Ida’s eyes fell on the telephone beside her bed and
lingered. She forgot her beautiful room and the successive
throbs of gratified ambition, in an overwhelming desire
to call up Gregory and tell him what she thought of
him. But she was a woman in whom calculation was
stronger than impulse, and in the past year she had learned
to control her temper, not only because a carefully nourished
refinement had crowded out some of the weeds of
her nature, but because her ever-growing intelligence
despised lack of self-control in all things. So she merely
undressed herself, her eyes wandering every few minutes
to the telephone. It was incredible that he did not ring her
up. That, at least, would take but a few moments of his
precious time.</p>

<p>However, she fell asleep immediately after her bath, and
it was the telephone bell that awakened her at eight
o’clock. This time she frowned at it, for she wanted to
sleep; but she sat up, put the receiver to her ear and asked
languidly: “Well?”</p>

<p>A strange man’s voice replied: “Is this Mrs. Compton?”</p>

<p>“Yes. Why am I disturbed so early?”</p>

<p>“I’m sorry—this is Mr. Compton’s secretary speaking—but
Mr. Compton told me to call you at eight o’clock.
He always comes in for breakfast at this time—here he is.”</p>

<p>“Hello! How are you? What time did you get in?”
Gregory’s voice was elaborately polite and as eager as any
lover’s of yesteryear.</p>

<p>“Are you interested?” Ida’s heart beat thickly, but her
tones were crisp. “I arrived at midnight. Really, I expected
you to meet me. That is generally considered the
decent thing to do.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[234]</span>“Oh! I’m sorry it was impossible. I can’t leave the
mine at present. How did you like the house?”</p>

<p>“I am enchanted with it—and with the limousine. When
are you coming in?”</p>

<p>“I can’t say at present. I dare not leave for a moment.
You will find a deposit to your credit at the Daly bank.”</p>

<p>“Thanks. Would—shall I run out?”</p>

<p>“Better not. There is always danger of rows.”</p>

<p>“But of course I’m wild to see the mine. You forget
how famous it is.”</p>

<p>“Better wait awhile. It really isn’t safe.”</p>

<p>“Very well. How’s your wound? Where were you
hurt, anyhow?”</p>

<p>“Not worth mentioning, as I cabled you, and I suppose
you got my telegram in New York saying I was all right
again. Sure you got everything you want?”</p>

<p>“I am overwhelmed by all this luxury, and your generosity.”</p>

<p>“Glad you like it. Has Mrs. Blake gone to California?”</p>

<p>“She went directly from the steamer. How is Mark
getting on. I’ve had only notes from Ora.”</p>

<p>“All right. He doesn’t write but has telegraphed once
or twice. He’d better stay below several months. Write
Mrs. Blake to persuade him to take things easy. He had
a close call. I can get along without him for awhile,
but I can’t afford to lose him. Will you see to this?”</p>

<p>“I’ll write Ora today. She’s in no hurry to return to
Butte—was delighted at the prospect of going to California,
and intends to take Mark to Santa Barbara, where
she knows a lot of people.”</p>

<p>“Ah! Good. Well, I must get some breakfast. Amuse
yourself.”</p>

<p>“And you won’t be in for several days?”</p>

<p>“Afraid not. Good-bye.”</p>

<p>Ida set the receiver back on the table, but it was some
minutes before she lay down again. She sat thinking,
with compressed lips. Born with intuitive knowledge of
men, she had, as she once remarked to Ora, turned a
goodly number of them inside out during the past year.
Gregory Compton did not intend to live with her again.
She knew this as conclusively as if his kind matter-of-fact
tones had expressed the direct message. Before she left
home it never had occurred to Ida to wonder if her husband<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[235]</span>
still loved her or not, and she had learned to accept
his consuming masculine interest in matters mineralogic
as all in the day’s work. Now she wondered if he had
ceased to love her then or since. That he took no further
interest in her as a woman, although amiably determined
to do his duty as her legal provider, would have been almost
patent to an imagination as riotous as Ora’s; to Ida,
practical and clear-sighted, there was not a loophole for
delusion.</p>

<p>In a few moments she relaxed the tension of her body
and lay down.</p>

<p>“Well!” she thought impatiently, “what’s the matter
with me, anyhow? Isn’t it what I always hopefully looked
forward to? Did I ever pretend to be anything but resigned—or
to be in love with him after the first few weeks?
I guess I’m spoiled with too much devotion, that’s what.
Seeing too many men lose their heads. Much their old
heads are worth. But I guess I don’t like being turned
down for once. Goose. It’s my lay to cut out pique and
sing a song of thanksgiving that I’ve got pretty nearly
everything I ever romanced about and set my mind on.
It’s a pretty good old world when things come your way,
and women’ll never be happy till they learn to put men
in the same place that men put us—on a handy little side-track.
I’ve got a whole parlour car instead of an upper
berth like some poor devils, so I’ll quit whining. But if
there’s another woman in the case, let them both look out—that’s
all!”</p>

<p class="drop-cap">IDA slept for two hours longer and rose in a philosophical
mood. As she more than once had remarked to Ora,
“nothing in life is just what you figured it out beforehand”;
and this, one of life’s most unwelcome lessons,
it had not taken her twenty-six years to learn. She had,
in fact, accepted and docketed it while women twice her
age were nursing their illusions.</p>

<p>She had expected to be met at the station not only by
her husband but by Ruby and Pearl, to say nothing of
reporters. “She had slunk in like a nobody,” and her husband
declined to feed the fires of her vanity, blazing so
merrily these last ten months. Never mind. She had the
genius of quick readjustment and a sharp eye for the next
move in the great law of compensation.</p>

<p>“And believe me,” she thought, as she put the finishing
touches to her smart morning street costume, and
taught the admiring Swede how to pin on a veil, “the
gods have provided the goods pretty liberally, and I don’t
belong to the immortal order of female jackasses. Nine-tenths
of women’s troubles, mental and physical, sprout
in that hothouse corner of their skulls they call imagination.
None of it in mine. Let us eat and drink, for tomorrow
we shall die. Wait till I’m launched in Butte.
And just wait till I give a dinner party to the second son
of an English duke. Tra la la!”</p>

<p>Before the morning was over even philosophy had folded
her wings. If life had been niggardly yesterday she gave
with both hands today. When Ida arrived at the bank she
was received with exceeding deference by the vice-president
and informed that he had recently invested two hundred
thousand dollars in her name, acting on instructions
from Mr. Compton; and that as a large part of it
was in mortgages the interest in some cases ran as high
as eight per cent. The money had been placed in his hands
for investment shortly after the great land deal, details<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[237]</span>
of which had reached the public ear in due course and
greatly added to the prestige of Gregory Compton. In
fact it had invested his remote and ambiguous personality
with an almost sinister significance. As Ida listened to
the story of this transaction (she barely had opened a
newspaper in New York and knew nothing of it), she
found herself wondering if it could be true that once she
had possessed this man of whom even bankers spoke with
bated breath. It was patent that they stood in awe not
only of the rapid and masterly strokes which had increased
his little patrimony by something over two millions in less
than a year, but of his colossal luck, his sensational reputation
as a “winner”, and his open defiance of the greatest
of all great trusts.</p>

<p>It seemed to Ida, as she sat in the vice-president’s office
listening to his classification of her husband with
Marcus Daly, W. A. Clark, and F. Augustus Heinze, the
three commanding figures heretofore in the financial history
of Montana, and to predictions that Compton would
go farther than any one of his predecessors, that she
might have known Gregory in his extreme youth or in
some previous existence; but that this man who now not
only ranked first in the eyes of all Montana, but had
focussed the attention of a continent, no longer touched
her life save as a fairy-godfather. It was the first time
that she had appreciated his fame. She had been absorbed
in Europe and its diversions—and diverters; the
new wealth had been accepted as a matter of course; her
imagination had not been powerful enough to visualise at
a distance what her mind grasped the moment the facts
were presented to her in the measured yet glowing terms
of a bank’s president.</p>

<p>“He always did feel himself a cut above me,” she
thought grimly as she left the building and walked down
Main Street. “And now, I suppose, he thinks Perch of the
Devil is Mount Olympus, and that he is some god. It
would be fun to put a nick or two in his halo—but never
mind: I’ve got a cool two hundred thousand—<i>and</i> a palatial
residence, <i>and</i> a limousine—sounds like a fairy tale.
There’s nothing mean about him, anyhow.”</p>

<p>When she reached her beautiful home she found four
reporters awaiting her. They apologised for not meeting
her at the train, but as hour after hour had passed with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[238]</span>
discouraging reports, they finally had gone home to recuperate
for the next day’s labours. Ida dismissed the last
of her regrets, and told them all that she wished Butte
to know at once, showed the women the contents of her
trunks, which the maids were unpacking, promised to let
them know when the newer Paris wardrobe arrived, and
finally gave them lunch. Reporters are the quickest people
in the world to detect affectations, assumptions, and
false values, and the most merciless in their exposure;
but, although these four were on the alert, they could find
neither traces of original commonness nor imitation of the
British aristocracy. Ida apparently had consigned the
slang of her former class to the limbo of careless grammar,
and she was so simple and natural that they failed
to discover how clever she was; they agreed, as they walked
down Broadway, that she was merely a marvel of adaptability,
like so many others that had done credit to the
great state of Montana, to say nothing of the fluid West in
general.</p>

<p>But, although Ida could be anything she chose when
occasion demanded, she always sought relief from the
strain as quickly as possible. Immediately after the departure
of the reporters she telephoned for her limousine
and drove to the large “Block” in the heart of the business
district where Miss Ruby Miller kept the looks of
the Butte ladies up to par. As she left the elevator she
saw that the familiar door was open as usual and the old
screen before it. She tapped discreetly, and Miss Ruby
came out into the hall, removing the cold cream from her
hands with her apron.</p>

<p>“Ide!” she cried rapturously, throwing both arms about
her friend’s velvet shoulders. “Glory be, but I’m glad to
see you and you do look fine——”</p>

<p>“How mean of you not to meet me——”</p>

<p>“We had it all fixed and supper here, but gave it up at
ten o’clock. For all we knew you might not get in till
morning, and you know how we work——”</p>

<p>“Well, I’ll forgive you if you both come to dinner with
me tonight. I want to have one good old time before I
sit up and play the grande dame act for weeks on end——”</p>

<p>“I guess you’re one now without any play-acting. You
look the real thing all right. And I guess we won’t see
so awful much of you now——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[239]</span>“Do you mean because I’m harnessed up to a bunch of
money——” began Ida in high indignation.</p>

<p>“Oh, I know you’ll always feel the same, but grand
dames and our sort don’t gee at the same table. The West
is democratic but it ain’t too democratic. Don’t think
I’m jealous. You’re just where I’d like to be myself, and
I’m proud that one of us has got to the top so quick. My!
But Mr. Compton’s a wonder. To think that I ever dared
call him Greg—even behind his back. Well, he’ll be just
as proud of you as you are of him. Pearl’ll want to see
your hats.”</p>

<p>“She can copy them all. Be sure to come early.”</p>

<p>She felt warmed by the little interview, but as she went
down in the elevator she admitted to herself that her future
intercourse with her old friends must be sporadic, no matter
what her loyalty; and she wondered if her new friends
would take their place; or even be to her the half of what
Ora had become in the long intimacy of travel. She
shrugged her handsome shoulders. If you elected to mount
in life, you must pay the toll. Were she abruptly returned
to the old cottage in East Granite Street certainly
Ruby and Pearl would not compensate her. No, not for a
moment. You may slip back in life if you are not strong
enough to hold on, but you do not deliberately turn back
even for the friends of your youth. Neither does Progress
halt and sit down to wait for its failures to catch up.
Ida leaned back in her limousine and met the interested
eyes of many pedestrians of both sexes as her chauffeur
drove her about for an hour to get the air, and incidentally
to be looked at.</p>

<p>Today she was in a mood to enjoy Butte, and she deliberately
summoned the long anticipated sensations. She
revelled in the gaunt grey ugliness of Anaconda Hill which
flung its arrogant head high above the eastern end of the
great hill itself; in the sensation of driving over miles
of subterranean numbered streets, some of them three
thousand feet below, to which that famous mass of rock
and dirt and angular buildings was the portal. She
leaned far out of her car to admire the glittering mountains
that looked like blue ice topped with white, and decided
that they were far more original and beautiful than the
Alps of Austria and Switzerland; certainly they tugged
at her heartstrings and at the same time filled her with an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[240]</span>
unprecedented desire to sing. She noticed for the first
time that the violet foothills against the nearer mountain
east of the city seemed to close the end of the streets as
the Alps did in Innspruck, and gave the ragged overgrown
camp clinging to its high perch in the Rockies a redeeming
touch of perfect beauty.</p>

<p>She drove out to Columbia Gardens, bought flowers from
the conservatory for her rooms, and wandered about recalling
the many gay times she had had in the dancing
pavilion. But her eye was suddenly arrested by the steep
mountain behind, then dropped slowly to the base. It
was there that she had promised to marry Gregory Compton.
She remembered his young passion and her own.
She had never felt anything like it again; nor had he ever
been quite the same. Was it one of those “supreme moments”
novelists so blithely alluded to? The logical inference
of that old bit of bathos was that such moments
had no duplicates. She felt faint and dizzy for a moment;
then walked back to her car, smiling grimly as she
realised that she had experienced a fleeting echo of that
vast unattainable desire women live and die cherishing
or bewailing. “Poor things! Poor things!” she thought,
with the first pang of pity her sex had ever inspired. “No
wonder they go in for suffrage, art, work, any old thing.
Home,” she added to the chauffeur.</p>

<p>She peremptorily dismissed all thought of the past during
the drive back to town and reverted to her pleasure
in once more feeling a part of her surroundings, hideous
though they might, for the most part, be; instead of walking
with alert critical eye through what always must seem
to her the animated pages of ancient history. But her
complacency received a sudden shock. The car was rolling
along Park Street when her eye rested upon a man’s
face vaguely familiar. She had bowed graciously and the
face was behind her before she realised that the man was
Professor Whalen, and that, for a second, she had looked
into a pair of pale blue eyes that sent her a swift message
of hate.</p>

<p>Ida shuddered. The warm light air of her beloved
Rockies turned cold and heavy. “I feel as if I’d stepped
on a snake and just missed getting bitten,” she thought,
putting her sensations into a concrete form, after her
habit. “I had forgotten the little viper was alive, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[241]</span>
I wish to goodness he wasn’t.” She had flouted superstition
always, but she could not shake off the sense of menace
and evil that had vibrated from the man until she was
within her own doors once more. Then she became as
oblivious of Whalen’s existence as during that late exotic
period when everything connected with her old life had
seemed too crude to be real.</p>

<p>The parlour maid handed her a note that had arrived an
hour before from Mr. Luning, Mark’s partner. Mrs.
Blake, he wrote, had bought a present for Mrs. Compton
in Paris and sent it to the care of her husband’s firm.
Mr. Luning had gone the day before to Great Falls to
clear it in the Custom House, and now had the pleasure of
forwarding the boxes, etc.</p>

<p>“Good gracious!” exclaimed Ida, “what can it be?”</p>

<p>“There’s four big boxes in the back hall, ma’am.”</p>

<p>Ida lost no time. If Ora had given her a present it
must be worth looking at, and she went as rapidly as
dignity would permit to the nether regions and ordered
the boxes opened. The present proved to be a magnificent
silver service, from many dozens of “flat ware” to massive
platters, vegetable dishes, flower, fruit and bon-bon pieces,
and candelabra. The delighted servants made a shining
display on the dining-room table, and after Ida had
gloated over it for a time and informed her audience that
it was copied from a royal service in the Louvre, she went
suddenly up to her bedroom. This time she did shed a few
tears, and as she looked at her handkerchief in some wonder
she decided that there was at least one person that
she loved, “hard-headed” as she was, and that Ora Blake
had found the one soft spot in her flinty heart and wormed
herself into it. She went to her desk immediately and
wrote Ora a letter that was almost tender, admitting that
she missed her “like fury”, and begging her to return
soon.</p>

<p>“Greg telephoned this morning,” she concluded, oblivious
that she was betraying the fact that she had not
seen her husband, “and told me to tell you to keep Mark
down below for several months. But his lungs must be
well by this time or he’d be dead. And the rest of him
will mend all the sooner in this magnificent air. Heavens,
but it’s good to breathe it again! It makes one feel as
if the atmosphere of Europe hadn’t been aired for a century.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[242]</span>
I’ve got a wonder of a house and a jim dandy of a
limousine, but ever since I came I’ve felt kind of homesick,
and I’ve just realised it’s for you, old girl. So, come
home. Once more ten million thanks.”</p>

<p>And when Ruby and Pearl dined with her that night she
realised that all her old zest in their society was gone.
Ida Hook, at least, had “passed on.”</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">IV</h3>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">IT was on the morning of this same day that Gregory
sat alone in his cabin uncommonly idle, for he still
spent the greater part of his time underground, when not
away on business connected with his new investments and
deals. For the last week he had not left the hill, and although
he was on the alert to hear his geological acumen
vindicated, he was in no mood to find pleasure in his mine.
His conscience, an organ that troubled him little, was
restive. In spite of his liberal disbursements, he knew
that he had treated Ida unfairly. He had long since made
up his mind to obliterate her from his personal life, and,
if the truth must be told about a man who had snapped
his fingers in the face of the most formidable combination
of capital in the world, he was afraid to meet his wife.
Vanity, he argued, in such women takes the place of
warmth, and he had no mind to burden his memory and
resource with an endless chain of subterfuges; nor had
he any relish for the bald statement that since he could
not have the woman he wanted he would have none; and
that his mine, as complex and mysterious, as provocative of
dreams, as capricious and satisfying as woman herself—to
say nothing of hard work and increasing power—was to
fill his life.</p>

<p>Ida might rage, stamp, scream, with her hands on her
hips, her superb eyes flashing. Worse still, she might weep,
lamenting that he loved her no longer—if he made her
hurried friendly calls. Far, far worse, he might succumb
to her beauty and superlative femaleness and hate
himself ever after. His was to be a life of unremitting
and constructive work; he must keep that blue flame
burning on the altar in his sanctuary. If he never paused
to draw it up into his consciousness he must know it was
there.</p>

<p>Better stay away until she understood all that it was
necessary she should know, wore out her pique in private,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[244]</span>
and accepted the situation. But he would have felt better
this morning if he had heard that her train had arrived
early in the evening. He might be ruthless, even where
women were concerned, but he was also sensitive and
capable of tenderness.</p>

<p>But he was not thinking of Ida alone. He was listening
for the footsteps of Joshua Mann, and in a few moments
he heard them, as well as the angry growl of his
foreman’s voice. Mann entered without ceremony.</p>

<p>“I’ve been looking for you, sir. We’ve the devil’s own
luck again——”</p>

<p>“Apex struck the Primo vein?”</p>

<p>“No, and won’t for fifty feet yet. But—well—I hate
to say it—we’ve lost our vein—cut off as short as if it had
been sawed. Of course, it’s faulted, and God only knows
where its dropped to—or how far. A prettier shoot of
ore was never uncovered. What’s worrying me is that—oh,
hell!—just suppose that’s what Amalgamated is sinking
on. My head’s going round. Can I have something?”</p>

<p>Gregory waved his hand toward the cupboard where
his visitors found refreshment. When Mann had braced
himself, his employer tapped a large sheet of paper that
lay on the table.</p>

<p>“Come here,” he said. “I made this map some time
ago, and calculated to a day when you would lose the
vein. I guessed our vein had faulted before Amalgamated
got busy. But don’t worry. They’re either on a
parallel vein or on a mere fork.” His pencil moved along
the vein already stoped, travelled over the fault line and
recovered a vein further down. “Hundred feet,” he said.
“With air drills and unless the fault breccia is uncommonly
hard, which I don’t think is the case, we should find
it in less than three weeks. They can’t get through that
rock for at least a month. Even then they may not touch
us, but then again they may, and we must be there first.
Cut across the fault at once and follow it on the footwall
side to the east. Get well into the footwall. If you don’t
recover the vein inside of a hundred feet I’ll stand to lose
a thousand dollars and you’ll be the winner.”</p>

<p>“I guess not,” said Mann admiringly. “But, by
jing! I was worried. You never can tell about them
faults. When the old earth split herself up and got to
slipping she not only lost one side of herself sometimes,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[245]</span>
but twisted about as if she was having fun with the apex
law of Montana in advance. But I figure out that you’re
like old Marcus Daly—you’ve got a sort of X-ray in your
eye that sees the ore winking below. So long.”</p>

<p>He departed to carry encouragement to the anxious
miners, and Gregory went out and walked along his hill.
By this time he knew every inch of it, and had found indications
of ore in his other claims while superintending
the development work necessary before perfecting his patents.
If Amalgamated sank on his present vein and the
courts enjoined him from working it until the matter of
apex rights was settled, he would simply go ahead and sink
through the carbonates in his other claims to those vast
deposits of chalcopyrite with which he was convinced his
hill was packed. He knew the geological history of every
mine in Montana, and while he had given up all hope of
finding gold on his estate save in small incidental values,
he believed that he possessed one of the greatest copper
deposits in the Rocky Mountains. And now that even one
vein of his hill was threatened, he dismissed his old dreams
with a shrug and transferred his undivided affection to
the exciting treasure the earth had given him. There were
few surprises in gold mines. A great copper mine might
make geological history. In two districts, Butte and Castle
Mountain, copper glance, an ore of secondary enrichment,
had been found far down in the sulphide zone below chalcopyrite,
chief of the primary ores. He believed that he
should find glance at depth of nine hundred feet. If
there were masses of it he should take out millions in a
year, for chalcopyrite was the richest of the permanent copper
ores of this region, running as high as 79.8.</p>

<p>He had been on amiable terms with the manager and
engineer of the Apex Mine since the battle underground,
and he crossed the claim unmolested to make his daily
inspection of the Primo shaft house. But there had
been no further attempt to use the cross-cut, although
the Apex people had managed before they were discovered
to drive to the point upon which they expected
to sink.</p>

<p>Gregory walked up the hill beyond to look at the cottage
just completed, which was to be occupied by the manager
and foreman of the Primo Mine as soon as Mark reopened
it. He had been about to begin operations, cutting across<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[246]</span>
the fault Gregory had demonstrated—a fault parallel to
the one in Perch of the Devil—when he was shot nearly
to death.</p>

<p>The cottage was situated in a clearing in the pine woods,
somewhat apart from the cabins, which were being renovated
and made comfortable for the miners. Gregory was
so positive that the pyroxenite vein would be recovered
just beyond the row of aspens, some sixty feet below
the tableland, that Mark, who believed his friend to be an
inspired geologist, was preparing for a long period of
mining; although if it had been a quartz mine Gregory,
sure as he was of his judgment, would not have permitted
him to put up a mill and concentrating plant until sufficient
ore had been blocked out to warrant the expense. But
pyroxenite went direct to the smelter, and a cottage could
always be rented.</p>

<p>The little bungalow had two bedrooms besides one for
a Chinese servant, a bathroom, and a large living-room
with a deep fireplace, a raftered ceiling, and pine walls
stained brown. Gregory, as he realised how cosy it would
be when furnished, wondered that he had been satisfied
with his two-roomed cabin for so long. He had been too
absorbed to think of comfort, but today he felt a desire for
something more nearly resembling a home than a perch.
He looked through the windows at the sibilant pines, the
pink carpet of primrose moss, the distant forests rising to
the blue and white mountains; and then he sighed as he
glanced slowly about the long room and pictured it furnished
in warm tones of red and brown, wondering if either
of the men would be married. It would be an ideal home
for a honeymoon.</p>

<p>He twitched his shoulders impatiently and went outside.
To his surprise he saw a wagon ascending the hill laden
with lumber, the seats occupied by the contractor and carpenters
that had built the bungalow.</p>

<p>“What’s up?” he asked, as the contractor leaped to
the ground.</p>

<p>“Another bungalow. Perhaps you could suggest a site.
It’s to be near this, and the same size. We had a telegram
from Mr. Blake yesterday.”</p>

<p>“But what does he want of two cottages?”</p>

<p>“Can’t say, sir, unless he means to come out here to
get well.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[247]</span>“That’s nonsense. He knows he could stay at my house
on the ranch.”</p>

<p>But Gregory was not in the habit of thinking aloud.
After indicating a site he swung back to his hill, angry
and apprehensive. Could it be possible that Mark intended
to spend the summer at the mine and bring his wife
with him? As soon as he reached his cabin he sat down at
his table, and after getting his friend’s present address
from Luning, telephoned a long distance message to Pony
to be telegraphed to Mr. Mark Blake in Santa Barbara.
Its gist was that the weather was abominable and that Mark
must not think of anything so foolish as to bring his
weakened heart and lungs to this altitude. His services
would be imperative later when his solicitous friend locked
horns with Amalgamated, and meanwhile he was, for heaven’s
sake, to take care of himself and remain on the coast
until he was in a condition to work day and night.</p>

<p>He received an answer that afternoon.</p>

<p>“No intention of leaving here for two months. Lungs
pretty good, but shall wait for leg to heal. Ora wants
present cottage for herself as she intends to spend summer
at mine. Will you be on the lookout for a manager? He
can live in the lessee’s shack until the new cottage is built.
Might begin operations at once. Hope this not too much
trouble. Mark.”</p>

<p>This message was transmitted over the telephone, and,
to the excessive annoyance of the operator, who happened
to be the belle of Pony, Gregory asked her three times,
and with no excess of politeness, to repeat it. The third
time he wrote it out and stared at the words as if the
unsteady characters were recombining into a sketch of the
infernal regions.</p>

<p>“Good God!” he thought. “And I can’t get away!”</p>

<p>Was Mark mad? Was she mad? Then he realised the
blissful ignorance of both regarding the drama he so often
had swept from the stage of his mind, that secret dweller
in the most secret recesses of his soul. Doubtless Ora
never had thrown him a thought since they parted at her
gate. He remembered her expressed intention to live at
her mine when the lease was up, her desire to adventure
underground, her intense appreciation of the romance of
mining. He closed his eyes, his face relaxed. So long as
she cared nothing for him there was no danger; he might<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[248]</span>
daydream about her a bit. At least—at last!—he should
see her again, talk to her, work with her, help her as no
one else could help her. If the association he would have
avoided was inevitable why not welcome it as a brief oasis
in what must be an arid life, so far as mortal companionship
was concerned?</p>

<p>But he was not the man to dream long. Presently he
opened his eyes, set his jaw until it looked a yard long, put
on his overalls, and went underground.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">BUTTE long since had made up its mind as to the social
future of Mrs. Gregory Compton. That Ida’s mother
had been a laundress and her father a miner concerned
the ladies of Butte as little as many similar outcroppings
of family history peculiar not only to Montana but to all
regions of recent exploitation and rapid growth.</p>

<p>In the hearty welcome extended to the newcomer, with
either the money or the personality to command its attention,
Butte more nearly resembles London than any other
city in the world. To pasts she is indifferent, provided
they are not resurrected as models for a present: she asks
no questions of a pretty, amiable, amusing woman who
pays her the compliment of sojourning in her midst, so
long as the lady exercises an equal reticence—assuming
reticence to be her virtue—and plays the social game with
<i>savoir faire</i>. Distractions on that high perch are few,
social life ebbs oftener than it flows, many of the large
houses are closed for the greater part of the year, and only
the very young, who care not where they are so long as
they may dance, find life in an overgrown mining camp as
satisfactory as their elders find New York.</p>

<p>But the hospitality of Butte is genuine and founded
largely upon common sense. Most of the women composing
its society have enjoyed wealth for many years: they
have travelled extensively; and if they continue to make
their homes in Butte it is solely on account of their own
business interests or those of their men. They argue that
to deprive themselves of even the casual diversion, assuming
the exclusive airs of large and resourceful communities,
would merely put them on a level with thousands of other
small towns slowly stagnating, be unworthy of their
worldly experience, and of the large free spirit of the
Northwest which has pervaded that isolated camp since
they came with their husbands or fathers to take a hand
in its history.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[250]</span>As for Mrs. Gregory Compton all they knew of her
in her present stage of development was favourable, although
several had a lively remembrance of the rosy black-haired
Ida Hook delivering her excellent mother’s laundry
work at their back door, and receiving more or less of her
“cheek.” But they had heard, at the time, of her lessons
with Professor Whalen, and of Ora Blake’s coincident interest.
Of her social advantages and triumphs in Europe
the press had kept them informed; she returned to Butte,
in fact, as one new-born. Moreover, she now owned one
of the finest houses in the city for entertaining, they knew
that she had elected to shine in Butte rather than in
London (that Mecca of so many quick-rich women without
position in their own country); and above all she was the
wife of Gregory Compton, the man in whom Montana was
beginning to feel assured it could take an unequivocal
pride, not only for his diabolical cleverness, but because
he was as “straight” as the Twentieth Century in the
United States of America would permit. Butte felt devoutly
grateful to Ida for being and returning, and, with
that utter lack of affectation that characterised it, began
calling two days after her arrival.</p>

<p>Ida would have been glad to have had Ora’s support and
advice during this ordeal—which caused her far more
apprehension than ducal week-ends. But she summoned
all her acquired knowledge and tact, fortified it with her
native and supreme confidence in herself, and made no
mistakes. Butte was charmed with the severe rich gowns
that set off her haughty head and warmly colored face
and the long, flowing, yet stately lines of her beautiful
figure; charmed also with a manner that was both simple
and dignified. She showed no enthusiasm at being taken
up so promptly, neither did she quite accept it as a matter of course.
If her talk ranged freely over common acquaintance
in London, the Paris dressmakers of the season,
the new opera, the plays of the moment in New York, it
was without glibness, and she took a firm hold on the
older and more important women of the community by confiding
to them that she should not make her first venture
in the difficult art of entertaining until her friend Mrs.
Blake returned to help her through the novitiate. Many
of the younger women were the wives of Amalgamated
officials and attorneys, or of men in a relationship to that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[251]</span>
mighty power but one degree further removed; but the
men individually were too broad-minded to cherish a personal
grudge against Compton, and they were, moreover,
quite as eager as their mates to meet his handsome wife.</p>

<p>During the ensuing fortnight Ida dined out every night,
went to a bridge party every afternoon, as well as to
several luncheons, teas, and dances. She wore a different
costume every time she appeared in public; but although
there was at the moment nothing in Butte to compare with
her gowns she never produced the effect of outshining the
other women by anything but her beauty and individual
style. In short her success was so immediate and so final
that, although she liked these ladies of her native town
even better than she had anticipated, her rapid conquest
soon lost its novelty, and she wished that Ora would return;
not only because she missed her increasingly, but because
to entertain in her great house would give her a new and
really poignant excitement, and lift her definitely from
the ranks of the merely received.</p>

<p>Gregory telephoned every few days, and never twice at
the same hour. When she found herself restlessly awaiting
the ring of the instrument, she dashed out of the house
angrily and took a walk. If she found upon her return
that he had called her up, she felt that he had given her
the excuse to telephone to him, and she soon learned at
what hours she could find him either in his cabin or down
in the mine, where he had a booth. She was furious at
what she called her raging female vanity, and if she could
have found another man to assuage it she would not have
hesitated to press him into service at whatever cost to
himself. But, as happens more often than not, there was
not an unmarried man in Butte old enough to be worthy
of a fastidious woman’s notice. She would have yawned
in the face of “Brownies”, and, although more than one
roving husband would have placed himself at her disposal,
she was the last woman to court scandal or even
gossip. She longed for the advent of Lord John Mowbray,
whose gayety would distract her mind, and whose devotion
make her forget that she was a neglected wife. She could
throw dust into the eyes of Butte by pretending to be his
matrimonial sponsor.</p>

<p>But for the first time she wished that she had children.
The great house seemed to demand the patter of small<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[252]</span>
feet, the slamming of doors, a row of naughty faces peering
over the banister of the second floor. It was terribly
silent. And yet she had felt settled down in that house
at once, so long had one of its kind been the object of her
unswerving desire; its atmosphere already seemed to hang
listless with ennui. She subscribed to both the state and
city suffrage fund, for she felt a new sympathy for women
who were trying to fill their lives, and sincerely hoped
they would invent some game that would make them independent
of men.</p>

<p>Seventeen days after her return she was sitting in the
library, trying to forget her solitary luncheon in a novel
when she heard the front doorbell ring. Her servants
were amiable but not too competent, and she waited
impatiently and in vain for one of them to answer the
summons. She restrained the impulse to open the door
herself. This was now an obsolete custom among her new
acquaintance; although having the front door shut in
one’s face while the colored maid took one’s card to the
lady of the stately mansion was hardly an improvement,
and this had been her experience a day or two ago. She
rang the bell in the library. Still there was no sign of life
from the high-priced young women who doubtless were
gossipping over the back fence. Ida’s curiosity overcame
her. The hour was too early for callers. It might be a
cable. She stole to the front door and peered through its
curtain of Honiton lace. Then she gave a war whoop which
would have horrified her servants—who, careless as they
were, stood in awe of her—flung the door open, caught Ora
in her arms and almost carried her into the library.</p>

<p>“Good Lord, but I’m glad to see you!” she cried. “I’m
just about dead of lonesomeness. Why didn’t you telegraph?
I’d have met you if your train didn’t get in till
two in the morning.”</p>

<p>Ora laughed and disentangled herself, although she
kissed Ida warmly. “I just got in—came here on the
way from the station and sent my bags to the house—but
I always did hate to be met. How beautiful your
house is.”</p>

<p>“It’s all right. But it’s about as cheerful to live alone
in as one of those palaces in the Via Garibaldi! My, but
I’m glad you’re here. You’re the only person I ever
missed, and being a real lady for weeks on end is telling on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[253]</span>
my plebeian health. I didn’t have any relief even in New
York. How’s Mark?”</p>

<p>“Quite well, except for his broken leg.”</p>

<p>“Is he here?”</p>

<p>“Oh, no—I left him in Santa Barbara—that is to say
at the Club House at Montecito, the fashionable suburb.
He has a jolly circle of friends there, and has no desire to
travel any further until he can walk.”</p>

<p>Ida put her hands on Ora’s shoulders and turned her
round to the light. “What’s up?” she demanded. “You
look fine, as pretty as a picture—but—different, somehow.”</p>

<p>“I’ve left Mark.”</p>

<p>Ida glanced into the hall. The opening of back doors
indicated that one of the maids had condescended
to remember she was a wage earner. “Let’s go upstairs,” said
Ida; and as they crossed the hall she said to the girl who
was hastening to the front door with a propitiating smile,
“You’re just about ten minutes too late, as usual, and the
next time it happens you lose your job. I’m not the sort
that sits down and wails over the servant question. This
house will be run properly if I have to send East for help.
Now put on your hat and run down to Mrs. Blake’s house
and bring up her bags, and tell them to send her trunks
here.</p>

<p>“Yes, you’re going to stay with me for the present,”
she said, as Ora protested. “Don’t say another word
about it.”</p>

<p>Ora shrugged her shoulders, and when they were in
Ida’s bedroom she took off her hat and coat and wandered
about aimlessly for a few moments. Ida was almost breathless
with impatience and a curious sense of apprehension
that vaguely recalled the strange terror Ora had inspired
on the day of their meeting. Ora wore a blue frock, and
Ida noticed that the yellow room did not dim her fair
radiance. If possible she was holding her head higher than
usual, her skin “gleamed” more than ever, there was a
curious light in her always brilliant eyes, half defiant, half
exultant.</p>

<p>“Do sit down!” said Ida sharply, cutting short Ora’s
voluble approval of the room. “There, that’s right,” as
Ora flung herself into a chair. “Now, fire away. You’re
brimming over with something. Do you mean that you’ve
left Mark for good and all?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[254]</span>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Told him so?”</p>

<p>Ora nodded.</p>

<p>“Did you tell him about Valdobia, or what? For heaven’s
sake open up.”</p>

<p>“No, I—I thought I wouldn’t tell him everything at
once. I told him that I meant to spend the rest of my
life in Europe, and that it was only fair to himself to
divorce me—he can do it easily on the ground of desertion—and
marry someone who would make a real home for
him—make him happy.”</p>

<p>“Ah! Mark’s the sort women marry but don’t fall in
love with. And what did he say when you handed him
that?”</p>

<p>“He was rather broken up.”</p>

<p>“Really! And you? I always had an idea that when
it came to the point you wouldn’t do it. You have high-falutin’
notions about honor, noblesse oblige, and all the
rest of it, to say nothing of being really soft, as I once told
you. There’s only one thing that would make you hard—to
everyone else—and that’s being in love——”</p>

<p>“That is it!” exclaimed Ora eagerly. “I’ve made
up my mind to marry Valdobia. I wasn’t so sure when
I left Europe, but you know what separation often
does——”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Ida dryly, “I do. Well, Mark will have to
take his medicine, I guess. I’ve never doubted, since Valdobia
joined us in Genoa, that he was the man for you.
It’s fate, I guess. But tell me what Mark said, after all.
Did he consent?”</p>

<p>“There was nothing else to do. He knew I meant it.
I broke it to him by degrees. Besides, he knew how it was
long before I left for Europe. He had practically given
me up. Of course he was fond of me—I had become a
habit and made him comfortable, besides being useful to
him—but—well, I gave him six years—my youth!” she
burst out passionately. “What wouldn’t I give to wipe
out those years, be twenty again and free! I tried to make
him understand that I was no longer in the least like the
bewildered undeveloped girl he had married; and that I
bore as little resemblance to the intellectual automaton I
made of myself later. I told him that I was awake once
for all, and that rather than live again with a man I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[255]</span>
couldn’t care for I’d be boiled in oil. Then he understood.”</p>

<p>“I should think he might! Of course he asked if there
was another man?”</p>

<p>“Yes, but I told him that was neither here nor there;
that in any case I should leave him and live in Europe.”</p>

<p>“Poor Mark! Tied by the leg, and lost in the shuffle!”</p>

<p>“You know as well as I do that I have nothing in me for
Mark and that if I cared as little for Valdobia it would
only be fair to give him a second throw for happiness.
When I left him he was quite resigned, and we have agreed
to remain the best of friends. I shall leave him my power
of attorney as before, and he will continue to manage my
affairs.”</p>

<p>“How much more sensible we are in our Twentieth Century!
No doubt he will visit you in the Palazzo Valdobia
when he takes a whirl at Europe.”</p>

<p>“Why not? But tell me you think I did right, Ida?”
Ora’s voice was very sweet and plaintive.</p>

<p>“You did what you were bound to do, I guess, when you
met a man that could throw a lariat round the neck of that
romantic imagination of yours. Right? I don’t know. I
guess I’ve got the same old streak of Puritan Americanism
in me, although if other people want to have <i>liaisons</i> and
divorces it’s none of my affair. Women will do more
and more as they damn please, I guess, men having set
them such a good example for a few centuries. But I
simply hate the idea of losing you. I want you right here
in Butte. Lord, I’ve almost forgotten may slang!”</p>

<p>Ora laughed with something like her old merriment.
“Oh, you’ll have me for an escape valve for a while yet.
Valdobia’s mother is dying of some lingering horrible
disease. It wouldn’t be decent for me to go to Rome, and
I should be lonely anywhere else. So, I’ve made up my
mind to stay here during the summer at least, and realise
a dream I used to indulge in before I ever knew I could
fall in love.” Once more she looked straight at Ida, this
time with the slow expectant smile of a child. “I’m
going to reopen my mine and run it myself—of course I
shall have a manager. Mark has written, or telegraphed,
to Mr. Compton to find one for me—but I shall live out
there and go down every day, and make believe I am doing
something, too—at all events realise that it <i>is</i> my mine.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[256]</span>
Mining has always—that is, always did fascinate me more
than anything else on earth. I shall be devoted to Valdobia
when I am married to him, but I simply must have that
adventure first——”</p>

<p>“For heaven’s sake don’t go dotty like Gregory over
a hole in the ground. If you get that bee buzzing round
in your skull I pity poor Valdobia. If it were not for his
mother I’d cable to him to come out——”</p>

<p>Ora’s face set with a hardness that arrested Ida’s observant
eye. “Don’t you do anything of the sort. Mark
said once about my father, ‘It was characteristic of him
that when he quit he quit for good.’ I am always discovering
more and more of my father in me. I’ll live that old
dream and it will finish when Valdobia and I both are free.
Then I shall wipe it off the slate—consign it to limbo.”
She sprang to her feet and stretched out her arms. “I am
going to do exactly as I please as long as I am free. Of
course I am mad about Valdobia—you know that I
wouldn’t marry him if I were not—but I am mad too about
liberty and my mine. This is my only chance. And I am
a Montanan, born in the Rocky Mountains. I want something
of the life that has made my state famous before I
become a European. I’ve never had anything of her but
Butte. I want the wild mountains—I want, above all,
the mine that has given me my freedom. I’m going to
wear overalls and go down into the mine every day.”</p>

<p>“A sweet sight you’ll be!” said Ida disgustedly. “And
the miners—Oh, they’ll just love the idea of having a
woman at their heels! What on earth has got hold of you?
It’s the only time I’ve ever known you to get off your base.
Why, there’s nothing a woman can do at a mine unless
she’s a graduated mining engineer, and nothing then that
a man couldn’t do better. You’ll be in the way and you’ll
soon be bored to death yourself. If you’re so crazy about
Montana why don’t you do some of those great things for
her that your father suggested? And how do you reconcile
your marriage to an Italian with your devotion to
your father’s memory?”</p>

<p>Ora turned away her head. “My father gave me too
much of himself to expect me to play the rôle of ministering
angel to anything. I intend to invest in Montana the
greater part of all that I take out of my mine. If it gives
me one of the great fortunes I shall endow my state in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[257]</span>
some way—as Mark may suggest. But I cannot live here.
That is for ever settled. When I go to Europe I shall
never return—not even to America. I shall forget my life
here, everything connected with it—everything! One
side of me is already European. I shall become
wholly so.”</p>

<p>“Somehow,” said Ida slowly, and with the sensation of
being so close to something that she couldn’t see it, “I
don’t get the idea that you’re so mad about Valdobia.
Long since I figured that when you did love a man you’d
be a sort of white pillar of flame about him. I firmly
believe that Valdobia is the man for you, but, well—he fell
too quickly. He didn’t make you suffer, never kept you
guessing for a minute. The women that turn men’s heads
are a good deal like men themselves; they’ve got to be
hurt hard and kept on tenterhooks before they are in a
condition to accommodate the virus. You are fond of
Valdobia, and well you may be, but mad isn’t the right
word——”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes it is! It is!” Ora was walking up and down
the room. “You must believe that I love him as I never
dreamed I could love anybody——”</p>

<p>“Hi!” cried Ida. “Your letter-man! That’s what!
You were more nearly in love with him than you are with
Valdobia, and because, for some reason or other, you
couldn’t get him. Where is he?”</p>

<p>Ora’s eyes looked large and blank. “That! I had quite
forgotten it. It was the last of a long line of mental love
affairs. Those always evaporate even from the memory
when the real man comes along.” She sighed heavily and
sat down once more. “I know that I shall be happy with
Valdobia, only I am not happy now. That is so far off!
And of course I feel badly about poor Mark. But I
couldn’t help it. Not to do it would have been worse. And
I should go off my head meanwhile if I didn’t have this
mine. Do you think I could remain here in Butte and go to
dinners and bridge parties? I should scream in their
faces. I must have work. Be sure I can find something
to do at the mine—I suppose there are a laboratory and
assay office. And there will always be the excitement of
hoping to find free milling gold—at present what could
be more exciting than to drift for that lost vein?”</p>

<p>“It wouldn’t keep me awake nights. But have your<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[258]</span>
own way. I don’t want you down with nerves, and that
will happen if you don’t look out.”</p>

<p>“If I don’t get my own way.”</p>

<p>“Exactly. But I wish your way marched with mine.
I’ve missed you like fury—Say!—here’s an idea: I’ll go
back to Europe with you now if you like, and stay until
you marry. There are lots of places we planned to go to
and didn’t——”</p>

<p>“Ida, you are a dear! And you longed so for Butte.
Why it would be like tearing an author from his unfinished
magnum opus. Besides—well—you have a husband——”</p>

<p>“Oh, Lord! Gregory is running the Universe at present.
Women don’t exist for him. Shall we go?”</p>

<p>Ora shook her head. Her face had turned from white
to pale. “No. I must spend these last months of my
freedom here in my state. And that lost vein—it pulls
me. I <i>must</i> have that life for a few months—for the first
and last time. You—you—might spend your week-ends
with me.”</p>

<p>Ida scowled and turned away her head. She had no
intention of admitting even to Ora that Gregory deliberately
avoided her. “Not I. I hate the sight of the De
Smet ranch. Go, if you like, but I feel sure you will
come in often. And before you go I wish you would do
me a favour.”</p>

<p>“Of course I will.”</p>

<p>“Let me give you a dinner. I want to begin that sort
of thing and you’ll furnish the excuse besides helping me
out.”</p>

<p>“Very well. Have it soon. I want to go to the mine
as quickly as possible. I shall begin to send out the furniture
for my bungalow tomorrow.”</p>

<p>“A week’s notice will be enough. I’ll write the invitations
today. There’s another reason I want to give this
dinner. Gregory hasn’t been seen anywhere with me—hates
going out. But I shall make him understand that
he must come to my first dinner—or people will be talking—and
I hate people prying into my affairs. Besides, it
will be his duty to you as the wife of his best friend.
(He needn’t know you’ve left Mark yet awhile.) I’m not
hankering for the rôle of the neglected wife; and I’m sick
of making excuses. For all Butte knew I might not have
laid eyes on my husband since my return.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[259]</span>And although she spoke bravely Ora knew that she had
not. “We’ll have the dinner,” she said warmly. “And
it will be great fun to get it up——”</p>

<p>“Now, come this minute and go to bed. You are to
stay with me as long as you are in this camp, and I’m
going to tone you up, and make you rest as we used to
in Europe every afternoon—hard work in this altitude
but it can be done. I’ve got to go to a bridge party now,
and you are to sleep. If you feel rested when I get
back, I’ll call up two or three of your old friends and ask
them to come informally to dinner. So long.”</p>

<p>She closed the door of her best spare room on Ora and
walked slowly back to her own, her brows drawn; once
more quick with a sensation of profound uneasiness, of
being close to something that she could not see. But it
was not her habit to ponder for long over the elusive and
obscure. “Guess I’m worried about Ora’s health,” she
thought impatiently, and rang for her maid.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">VI</h3>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">TWO days later Gregory received the following note
from his wife:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Gregory</span>:</p>

<p>Ora is here, and before going out to the mine has promised to help
me through the ordeal of my first big dinner. Entertaining goes with
this house, and although I am beginning somewhat sooner, perhaps,
than is necessary, I have my reasons. I have asked twenty-four
people, the most important of the older and the younger married
sets. The dinner is to be at eight o’clock Tuesday. I want you to
come. Yow have been very generous, but there is one thing more
that you can do for me and I feel that I have the right to demand
it. If you no longer care for me, that is something I cannot help;
nor you either for that matter. But so far as the world knows, I am
your wife, and if we are never seen together there is bound to be
disagreeable gossip. I don’t want to be gossipped about. It is vulgar
and it complicates life. The Butte women I most wanted to
know are all right, but the town has the usual allowance of fools and
scandal mongers. By showing yourself at my first dinner in your
own house you will muzzle them. You can arrive in time for dinner
and take a late train back to Pony, if there is one. But please come.
I am sure if you think it over you will admit that I am merely proving
my new knowledge of the world in asking for your formal protection.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Ida.</span></p>
</div>

<p>Gregory read this note hastily when he found it in his
morning mail-bag in company with many business letters,
to which he also gave scant attention: he was in haste to
go underground. There was still no sign of the lost vein,
and nineteen days of the three weeks’ limit he had set
himself were gone. But they broke into it that same
afternoon. He barely left the mine until the following
morning, but he finally sought his cabin and bed satisfied
that the recovered vein of copper pyrite was, like the
original, six feet thick and as rich in values. When he
awoke he remembered Ida’s note, and although it had provoked
a frown of annoyance when he read it, his spirits
were now so ebullient that he not only admitted the justice<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[261]</span>
of her demand, but would have granted almost anyone a
reasonable request.</p>

<p>Moreover, as he reread the note, its restraint and dignity
struck him forcibly, as well as its remote likeness to
the Ida Hook he had wooed in Nine Mile Cañon. Certainly
she had made the most of her opportunities!</p>

<p>And apparently she had recovered from her first disappointment,
or pique—if, indeed, she had felt either—and
he assumed that the last year, crowded with exceptional
experiences, had made her over into something like a
woman of the world. No doubt among her many accomplishments
she had acquired self-control. (That she might
also have acquired finesse did not occur to him.) He
dismissed the fear that she would make a scene—and
himself thoroughly uncomfortable. On the whole it would
be interesting to see Ida as a bird of paradise. He remembered
her in shirtwaists and serviceable skirts, and recalled
that he had sometimes thought it a pity she should
not have the plumage worthy of her beauty and style.</p>

<p>And if the fates had willed that he must meet Ora
Blake again he preferred that the first interview should
be in public.</p>

<p>He rang up Pony and in the course of half an hour was
connected with Butte.</p>

<p>“Hello!” he said cordially, as he heard his wife’s voice.
“Got your letter, but couldn’t find time to answer before.
I’ll come to the dinner with pleasure.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I am so glad.” Ida’s tones were crisp and cool.
There was none of the husky warmth that Gregory suddenly
remembered; nor any of the old common inflection.
“Are your evening togs at Mark’s?”</p>

<p>“Yes, will you send for them?”</p>

<p>“I’ll have everything here in one of the spare rooms.
The maid will show you up if you are late. It takes me
hours to dress.”</p>

<p>“All right. Say—Ida—I wish you’d persuade Mrs.
Blake to give up that idea of coming out here. It won’t
work. She’ll only be in the way of the men, and if there
was a big row on would be one more responsibility for her
manager. I suppose she knows I’ve opened up her mine.
Besides, it’s no place for a woman anyhow. There are
only a few women—miners’ wives—in my camp; none in
the others.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[262]</span>“I’ve told her all that. But—well—you don’t know
Ora. Gambling—taking long chances—is in her blood, I
guess. You should have seen her at Monte Carlo. You
must take in Mrs. Cameron, but I am putting Ora on your
left as it is time you two got acquainted. Try to dissuade
her. I want her to stay here with me.”</p>

<p>“I’ll do my best. How are you getting on? Butte still
panning out?”</p>

<p>“I adore Butte and find nothing to change. It’s too
wonderful—to have all your old dreams come true like
this! I hope your mine is behaving. I heard a rumour
the other day that you had lost your vein——”</p>

<p>“Just found it again!”</p>

<p>Ida noted the exultant ring of his voice, and was about
to laugh when she changed her tactics swiftly. “Good!
I know just how fine you feel—and that it wasn’t the loss
of money that worried you either. Well, the dinner will
be a sort of celebration. Good-bye.”</p>

<p>“Good-bye.” There was a faint accent of surprise in
Gregory’s voice. Ida smiled and returned to her interrupted
toilette.</p>

<p>“Just let me get a good chance at him once more,” she
thought. “I’ll be eating copper before I get through, but
I don’t know him or his sex if he won’t be nibbling off
the same chunk.”</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">VII</h3>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THE next week was the busiest she had ever known.
All the people that had called on her called again on
Ora. Her cook collapsed when told to prepare a dinner
for twenty-eight people, and Ida, who would not hearken
to a public caterer and his too familiar idiosyncrasies,
telegraphed to St. Paul for a chef. What moments she
had to spare after consultations with this autocrat, with
a temperamental designer of menu cards, and with two
high-handed young women whom she had been persuaded
by the charitable Mrs. Cameron to engage to decorate her
rooms, were spent with certain works on copper and mining
that she had procured from the public library.</p>

<p>She looked forward to the evening of her dinner party
with a secret excitement that seemed to fork its lightning
into every recess of her brain, and electrify it with a sense
of the fulness of life—that hinted intoxicatingly of life’s
perfections. Not only was she to live the wildest dream
of Ida Hook, but she had made up her mind to bring the
most important man in Montana to her feet on that
triumphant night. That the man was her husband, won
the first time without an effort, lost through her own indifference
and ignorance, added tenfold to the zest of the
game. She knew the impression he must retain of her:
crude, obvious in her sex allurement, cheaply dressed, a
sort of respectable mining-camp siren; all her fascinations
second-rate, and her best points in the eyes of an absent-minded
husband her good-natured mothering and admirable
cooking.</p>

<p>If she had returned to find him as she had left him, a
mere brilliant hard-working student, and automatically attentive
to his home partner, no doubt she would have
slipped into her original rôle at once, for she was normally
amiable, and she had strict ideas of wifely duties, which her
insistent vanity and deliberate flirtations never for a moment
endangered. They also filled the practical wants of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[264]</span>
a nature not derived from artistic ancestors. She had had
her “flyer”, and, allowing for social triumphs, returned
to Butte to settle down; although it had been with a certain
complacency that she had reflected during the homeward
journey upon the altered circumstances which would
enable her to live like a civilised being in her own apartments
and see far less of her husband than formerly.</p>

<p>Her complacency had been treated to a succession of
shocks since her return; it had, in fact, finally gasped out
its life; although it had left self-confidence behind to sit
at the feet of her shrewd clear mind. She found a zest
entirely new in bringing to his knees a man who had
been her husband when she was too raw and conceited
to appreciate him, who had developed into a personage,
and who had conquered his mere maleness and put women
out of his life: she had consulted a detective agency and
convinced herself that her only rival was the mine. Ida
was nothing if not practical. Before preparing for her
siege she chose to know exactly where she stood. A rival
of her sex would have demanded one sort of tactics; a mere
mine and the quickened business instinct of a dreaming
but outclassing brain, although she did not underrate their
peculiar dead walls and buffers, exacted a different and
more impersonal assault—at first.</p>

<p>Much that she had failed to understand in her young
husband was clear to her now. His silences, his formidable
powers of concentration, his habit of thinking out his
purposes unto the smallest detail before verbal expression,
his tendency to dream, combined with lightning processes
of thought, were the indispensable allies of his peculiar
gifts: she had talked with too many brilliant and active
men during the past year, to say nothing of her daily association
with Ora, for whose inherited and progressive intellect
she had the highest respect, and her own development
had been too positive, rapid, and normal, not to be
fully aware that men born with the genius to conquer life
were equipped with powerful imaginations that necessarily
made them silent thinkers.</p>

<p>She had become intensely proud of her husband since
her return, and his neglect, coupled with his scrupulous
generosity, had stung her pride and aroused both desire
and determination to recapture what she had lost. She
had no great faith in her capacity for love; but not only<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[265]</span>
was she fascinated by Gregory for the first time but she
found him more worthy of her accomplished coquetry than
any man she had met in Europe. She was firm in her
resolve to repossess her husband, but not merely to satisfy
that pride which was the evolution of a more primitive
vanity; she felt a certain joyousness, a lilt of the spirit,
at the thought of spending her life with him, of being the
complete helpmate of such a man; even a disposition to
dream, which was so new in her experience that she banished
it with a frown. “If I let go like other fool women,
I’ll make a grand mess of it,” was her characteristic reflection.</p>

<p>She was dressing for the dinner when she heard him
enter the house. The parlour maid for once remembered
her instructions, and led him up to his room, which was
on the opposite side of the hall from his wife’s and at
the extreme end. Her door was ajar, she heard his voice—whose
depth and richness were decimated by the telephone—his
light foot ascending the stair. For the moment
she lost her breath, then with an angry jerk of the
shoulders regained her poise, and, in tones careless enough
to reassure any husband suddenly overwhelmed with the
awkwardness of his position, called out:</p>

<p>“Good evening, Gregory. Hope you’ll find everything
you want in your room. Ring if you don’t. See you
downstairs.”</p>

<p>“Oh—thanks!” Gregory swallowed an immense sigh
of relief. “I’ll be on time.”</p>

<p>Ida, assisted by the “upstairs girl”—she had not yet
found a ladies’ maid willing to come to Butte—continued
her toilette. Her gown was as nearly Renaissance as she
thought her native Northwest would stand at this stage
of her social progress. It was “built”—a word more appropriate
to woman’s dress <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 1600 than today—of
heavy turquoise-blue brocade, the design outlined here
and there with gold thread. The long wrinkled sleeves
almost covered her hands, and, like the deep square of
the neck, were tipped with fur. Her mass of blue-black
hair was closely twisted around her head from brow to the
nape of her neck, held above the low forehead by a jewelled
stiletto Ora had given her in Genoa, “to remind her of her
midnight diversions in the Renaissance palace over which
her dim ancestral memories brooded.” This she had dismissed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[266]</span>
as damn nonsense, but she liked the stiletto with
its rudely set stones, and had promised to wear it the first
time she got inside one of her near-Renaissance gowns.</p>

<p>The pale subtle blue of the dress made her eyes look
light and altogether blue, the thick black underlashes and
full white underlids giving them an expression when in
repose of cold voluptuousness. Her skin against the dark
edge of fur was as white as warm new milk. Her costume
and her regal air would have made her noticeable in the
proudest assemblage. She was well aware that not only
was she a very beautiful woman tonight but a dangerous
one. And she might have stepped from one of the tarnished
frames in the Palazzo Valdobia.</p>

<p>After the maid had been dismissed, she examined herself
even more critically. The coral of lip and cheek, while
still eloquent of youth and health, was more delicate than
of old; all suggestion of buxomness had disappeared. She
looked older than when she had left Butte; the casual
observer would have given her thirty years; her cheeks
were less full, her mouth had firmer lines; the cold grey-blue
eyes more depth, justified their classic setting. Even
her profile, released by the finer contour of cheek and
thrown into high relief by the severe arrangement of her
hair, contributed to the antique harmonies of her head and
form.</p>

<p>“You’ll do,” she said to her image, and went down
stairs.</p>

<p>Several guests arrived at once and she was standing before
her antique English chimneypiece carved in California,
chatting with three of them when Gregory entered
the room. She nodded amiably as if they had met too
recently for formalities. He took the cue and paused to
exchange a few words with two men that stood near the
door. But Ida had seen the startled opening of his narrow
eyes which meant so much in him. She also noted
that, as other guests came in, he looked at her again and
again. In truth Gregory was startled almost out of his
trained stolidity. He had known a certain side of Ida’s
cleverness, and believed when he sent her abroad that she
would make much of her opportunities, the greatest of
which was her constant association with Ora Blake; but
that she would return in less than a year looking the great
lady, and the handsomest woman he had ever seen, even<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[267]</span>
his energetic imagination had failed to consider. Magnetism,
as of old, surrounded her like an aura, but to this he
was insensible, his own magnetism having been caught and
entangled with that of another. He felt very proud of his
wife, however, and, with a sudden impulse of loyalty, he
crossed the room and stood at her side. He also was
prompted to say in a tone pitched to reach other ears:</p>

<p>“By George, you are simply stunning. I haven’t seen
this—a—frock—dress—before.”</p>

<p>“Gown, my dear, gown. It only arrived a few days
ago. I shall take you to Europe with me next time—”</p>

<p>“Take him soon!” said Mrs. Cameron. “Don’t give him
time to wear out before he has begun to live. Our tired
business men!”</p>

<p>“Next year!” said Ida, gayly. “He has half-promised
and I’ll not let him off.” As she looked into his eyes
with bright friendliness, his face relaxed with the smile
which, she suddenly remembered, always had won her from
anger or indifference. He was openly delighted with her,
the more completely as he was both puzzled and relieved to
see that those splendid eyes held neither cold anger nor
feminine reproach. Moreover, although they softened for
an instant before she was obliged to turn away, it was with
an expression that made her look merely sweet and
womanly, not in the least coquette or siren. Other guests
claimed her attention. He heard her give a little hiss, and
saw her eyes flash. Then he forgot her. Ora had entered
the room.</p>

<p>Her gown, of some soft imponderable fabric that gave the
impression of depth in colour, was the peculiar flaming blue
of the night sky of Montana. Gregory was reminded instantly
of the night they had sat on the steps of the
School of Mines, with the pulsing sky so close above them.
The upper part of the gown was cut in points that curved
above her slight bust, the spaces between filled with snow-white
chiffon which appeared to be folded softly about
the body. She wore her pearls, but at the base of her
slender throat was a closely fitting string of Montana
sapphires, of the same hot almost angry blue. Her little
head with its masses of soft ashen hair seemed to sway on
the long stem-like neck, her stellar eyes blazed. Her
costume extinguished every other blue in the room.</p>

<p>“Really!” said Mrs. Cameron, whose black eyes under<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[268]</span>
her coronet of iron grey hair were snapping, “these two
dear friends should have had a consultation over their
costumes for tonight.” She had never liked Ora, and
although, as the leader of Butte society, she made a point
of speaking well of all whom she did not feel obliged to
ignore, she had taken a deep liking to Ida; moreover,
always a handsome woman herself, she felt both sympathetic
and indignant. This was Ida’s night, and she
scented treachery.</p>

<p>She had addressed her remark to Gregory, but although
he looked at her politely he would not have heard thunder
crashing on the roof. He wondered if he were standing
erect; he had a confused impression that that wonderful
blue gown was burning alcohol whose fumes were in his
head and whose flames swirled through all his senses. And
the woman within those curling blue flames was so much
more beautiful than his memory of her that he forgot
not only his recent tribute to Ida, but her bare existence
until she tapped him sharply on the arm.</p>

<p>“Dinner has been announced,” she said. “You are
to take in Mrs. Cameron.” Ida was smiling again; she had
dismissed anger and annoyance; nothing was to dim the
radiance of her spirits tonight. She and Ora would be at
opposite ends of the table, and she could keep the length
of the drawing-room between them when they returned.</p>

<p>Gregory’s face never betrayed him, particularly when
he kept his eyelids down, and, as he shook hands with Ora
in the dining-room he told her he was glad to see her
again as casually as if his hand had not tingled to crush
hers. He talked with Mrs. Cameron, however, as long
as possible, but when her attention was claimed by the
man on her right, he was obliged to turn to Ora. By this
time his blood was still. Eating is commonplace work, and
talking the inevitable platitudes of a dinner’s earlier
courses will steady the most riotous pulses.</p>

<p>Ora smiled impersonally; her eyes might have beheld the
husband of her friend for the first time.</p>

<p>“I am so glad to be able to ask you something about
my mine,” she said. “Ida tells me that you have reopened
it.”</p>

<p>“Yes, they are already through the fault and driving
for the vein. There happened to be a good man here looking
for a job when I got Mark’s telegram, a young engineer<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[269]</span>
from the East, named Raymond. The miners are good
capable men, too, and as Osborne and Douglas installed
a compressor, the work should be pretty quick. I fancy
you’ll recover the vein in a week or two.”</p>

<p>“I wonder if I shall? Mark thinks you infallible, but
it seems too good to be true.”</p>

<p>“The vein is there, about a hundred feet down, but
how rich it is I do not venture to predict.”</p>

<p>“Well, never mind,” Ora smiled happily. “I shall have
the fun of looking for it, and I want to be with the men
when they find it.”</p>

<p>“Oh—Ah—It really would be better for you to give
up that idea of going out there to stay——”</p>

<p>“I thought I would give to you the opportunity to say
that at once! Do go on and relieve your mind.”</p>

<p>“It is neither safe nor desirable,” he said sulkily. “I
may have a row on my hands any minute. Your men and
my men are a decent lot, but the Apex have employed a
lot of scum so ignorant that there is no knowing what they
may do in a crisis—in the hope of currying favour with
their superiors. They would merely be made scapegoats or—canned—I
beg pardon, fired—but they don’t know that,
and they’re as hard a lot as Europe ever kicked on to our
dump heap. Better stay here for the present.”</p>

<p>“I’ve sent out all the furniture for the bungalow, and
Custer and a Chinaman to put it in order. I suppose my
engineer can camp in the other cottage until it is finished.
That is quite close to mine, I understand.”</p>

<p>“Oh, of course—but why not stay at my ranch
house——”</p>

<p>“That is too far from the scene of operations. Please
don’t bother about me. I should hate to think I was on
your mind—you have enough! I shall be well protected,
and I’ve even bought an automatic. I suppose being a
born Westerner I should call it a gun. But it’s such a
little one. I shall carry it always——”</p>

<p>“Yes, promise that.”</p>

<p>“I’ve even had a little bag made, like those they wore
years ago, to fasten to my belt, and I shall keep it in
that.”</p>

<p>“Very well.” He dismissed the subject. “I—ah—there’s
something I heard today, but perhaps I should not
speak of it. Only Mark is such an old friend of mine——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[270]</span>“I suppose you saw Mr. Luning and he told you that
we are to separate.”</p>

<p>“Yes, that is it.”</p>

<p>“I intend to live in Europe: I suppose you think that
a callous reason.”</p>

<p>“It’s as good as most reasons for divorce in this country.
When is Mark coming back?”</p>

<p>“Not for two months. Nothing will be done until then.
I want to have my mining experience first and I shall
leave Montana as soon as the papers are served.”</p>

<p>“Ah!”</p>

<p>Her partner claimed her at the moment and, his own
still being occupied, he observed her furtively. He thought
that she too looked older, but not because advantages had
improved her; rather—he groped for the words that would
give definiteness to his impression—as if some experience
had saddened her. She had a softer expression. The blood
rushed to his head and he almost choked with jealousy, his
intuitions carrying him straight to the truth. “By God!
She has loved some man,” he thought. Then he set his
teeth. So much the better.</p>

<p>But when she turned to him again, he said impulsively,
although his tones were light:</p>

<p>“You never did fit this Western life of ours. Of course
you have found a more civilised mate in Europe?”</p>

<p>“You are all wrong,” she said gaily. “My only love
at present is my mine. My mine! You should understand
if anybody can.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, I understand that magnet. But I naturally
thought——”</p>

<p>“What everybody else will think when the news is out.
But I am astonished that you should jump at anything so
commonplace.” Her heart was hammering under the concentrated
intensity of his gaze; and as if he realised suddenly
that he might be betraying himself he said sarcastically:</p>

<p>“As there are—I was told today—no less than six divorces
pending in this set which my wife has the honour
to entertain tonight, and as all are to intermarry, so to
speak, when liberated, my conclusion in your case was
probably due to the force of suggestion.”</p>

<p>“Well, I forgive you if you promise to believe none of
the absurd stories you are sure to hear. I am in love<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[271]</span>
with freedom. Now tell me what you think of Ida? Isn’t
she wonderful?”</p>

<p>Gregory looked down the table at his wife sitting between
the two most important men in Butte and entertaining
both with animated dignity. She met his eyes and
smiled brilliantly. She knew that he was proud of her;
she had accomplished the second manœuvre in her flank
attack: her first had been to put him at his ease.</p>

<p>“Yes,” he said to Ora. “She is. It is almost beyond
belief. And she is your handiwork!” The two might have
been life-long intimates, and Ida a mere kinswoman of
both, so little did the oddity of this discussion occur to
Gregory at least.</p>

<p>“And in a way my present to you.” Ora spoke with a
charming graciousness. “Mark had given me a tremendous
idea of your abilities. The day I met Ida I saw her
possibilities, and I made up my mind then and there that
when the world claimed you your wife should be not only
an inspiration but equipped to render you the practical and
social help that every rising man needs. Isn’t it splendid to
think that she will always sit at the head of your table?”</p>

<p>Gregory was staring hard at her again. “You did that
deliberately?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Yes. Deliberately. Ida is so clever that she was
bound to develop with your rising fortunes, particularly if
you sent her to Europe. But it would have taken longer.
I couldn’t wait. My father inspired me with the deepest
admiration and respect for our Western men. I had made
up my mind that you were born into the front rank, and
I wanted, as a Western woman, and my father’s daughter,
to do something to help you. Tell me that you are satisfied
and that you are as proud of Ida as she is of you—that—that—you
simply adore her.” She did not flinch,
and looked him straight in the eyes, her own full of young,
almost gushing, enthusiasm. Her heart had almost stopped
beating.</p>

<p>“I certainly am proud of her, and grateful to you. No
doubt she will be very helpful if I am forced into politics
to conserve my interests.” His tones were flat. He had
come to his senses, and he was too loyal to hint that he no
longer loved his wife: but Ora’s face was suddenly flooded
with a lovely colour, and her eyes looked like grey mist
through which the sun was bursting. She asked him,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[272]</span>“Aren’t you going to stay with us for a few days!
We’d love to have you?”</p>

<p>“I take the 6.10 for Pony in the morning. If I disappear
before the others it will be to snatch a few hours’
sleep in that gorgeous four-poster in my room. After living
in two rooms for so long I am oppressed with all this
magnificence——”</p>

<p>“Two rooms!” Ora’s voice rang out like an excited
child’s. Gregory, marvelling at the quick transitions of
her sex, thought he had never seen anyone look so happy.
The gentle melancholy that had roused his jealousy was
obliterated. “Two rooms!”</p>

<p>“There is another shack just beyond where my Chinaman
cooks for me, and bunks, but I have only a bedroom
and office—and a bathroom of sorts. Even my secretary
sleeps at the ranch house.”</p>

<p>“You dear innocent millionaire. No doubt the proletariat,
reading of your sudden wealth, and cursing you,
pictures you wallowing in luxury. Well, you shall come
and sit sometimes in my comfortable living-room. It is
time you relearned the a, b, c, of comfort—before you
relapse into the pioneer.”</p>

<p>“Your bungalow looks as if it could be made very homelike.”
He spoke with unconscious wistfulness, and she
raised friendly and impersonal eyes to his.</p>

<p>“You shall see. I have what the French call the gift
of installation, and I have sent out nice things. I shall
make tea for you when you come to the surface at the
end of the afternoon shift, and you shall sit in the deepest
of my chairs.”</p>

<p>“It sounds like heaven,” said Gregory, who despised
tea.</p>

<p>Professor Becke, who had taken her in, and Mrs. Cameron
simultaneously addressed their temporary partners,
and Gregory was now to listen to an account, both spirited
and kindly, of the admiration his wife had excited in her
native town. Mrs. Cameron suspected the breach, in spite
of the clever acting of both, and made up her mind to do
what she could to bridge it. She had not an inkling of
the cause, for, like Ida, she knew nothing of that fateful
hour on the steps of the School of Mines; but as there was
no gossip abroad about either Gregory or his wife, she inferred
that it was one of those misunderstandings that so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[273]</span>
often separate young couples, always prone to take themselves
too seriously. She knew that Gregory would value
her praise; he not only had been fond of her as a schoolboy,
when he spent an occasional Saturday with her son,
but he knew that her experience of the world was very
wide. She was a woman whom long years of wealth had
enabled to travel extensively, she visited intimately at
some of the greatest country homes in Europe, and she
had her own position in New York. She subtly made
Gregory feel prouder still of Ida, and then said teasingly:</p>

<p>“It is well that you have her devotion. I know of three
men that are quite off their heads about her——”</p>

<p>“Ah? Who are they?” A sultan may weary of his
sultana, but his sultana she is all the same.</p>

<p>“That I’ll not tell you. Even your wife could not, I
fancy. I’ve never seen a woman treat men with a more
careless impartiality. What a relief—with all these divorces
pending. Merely a shuffling of cards, too, I understand.
It is disgusting. I asked your wife as a personal
favour to me to invite none of them tonight. Butte either
has long orgies of respectability or goes quite off her
head.”</p>

<p>“My wife is singularly indifferent to men for a beautiful
woman,” replied Gregory, comfortably ignorant of his
beautiful wife’s depredations abroad. “Nor is she likely
to countenance divorce. She has a good deal of her old
New England mother in her.” He had a haughty contempt
for explanations as a rule, but his quick instinct had
caught the significance of his companion’s remarks; knowing
that Ida must wish to stand well with this amiable but
rigid arbiter of Butte’s court of last resort, he added:</p>

<p>“I am sorry not to be in Butte oftener, and give her
what little assistance a man may, but it is all I can do to
leave the mine for a few hours every week or two.”</p>

<p>“That is the fate of too many of our American women
married to our too busy American men. But—well—Gregory—I
have married sons and daughters, and I am an
old friend of yours. Young wives must not be neglected,
and resentment eats like a cancer until women are old
enough to be philosophical. Just think that over.” And
before he could answer Ida gave the signal and the men
were left alone.</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap2">AS the women dispersed about the long drawing-room
Ora laid her arm lightly round the waist of Ida, who
was standing for the moment apart.</p>

<p>“Your dinner is a tremendous success, my dear,” she
said, “and so are you. That gown! It makes mine look
so crude. I wish I had worn white as I intended until
the last minute. How splendidly everything went off. Not
a detail to criticise, and every woman has worn something
new from New York or Paris. But you—well, Ida, you
are always beautiful, of course, but tonight you are something
more than lovely.”</p>

<p>“Oh, am I?” Ida gave a little gasp, forgetting her passing
astonishment at so much tribute from Ora at once.
“Well, I ought to be. I never felt quite like this in all my
life. Geewhil—no, I’m too happy even for slang. I wish
I could sing.”</p>

<p>Ora sighed. “I’ve always known you would get everything
you wanted, and I can guess just how you feel tonight.
You are a complete success. How many people
ever are able to say that?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I feel as if I owned the earth!” But her brows
met in a puzzled frown. “I never felt, though, as if even
the conquest of Butte would all but send me off my head.
I never feel very much excited about any old thing; it’s
not my make; but I’ve got a sort of shiver inside of me,
and a watery feeling in the heart region. If that chef had
spoilt the dinner I’d have gone out and wrung his neck.”</p>

<p>“Well, nothing can go wrong now. The worst is over,
and no dinner was ever more delicious. Why don’t you
let them dance? I know that Mrs. O’Hara plays.”</p>

<p>“Good idea! I’ll ring this minute for a few of those
extra near-waiters to take out the rugs and move the furniture.”</p>

<p>Two of the younger women, who had returned not long
since from San Francisco, were showing their scandalised<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">[275]</span>
friends the turkey-trot when the men came down the hall
from the dining-room. Ida drew Gregory aside.</p>

<p>“Tell me,” she asked, with an eager almost childish
note in her voice new to him. “Did it go off well? Am
I all I ought to be after all the money you have spent on
me? Do I look nice in my fine clothes?”</p>

<p>Gregory patted her on the shoulder. “I know little
about such things,” he said kindly, “but it outclassed all
the banquets I’ve been obliged to attend in the last six or
eight months. I felt quite proud that it was in my own
house—yours, to be literal—and Mrs. Blake assured me
that she had never seen anything better done.”</p>

<p>“Ora is an angel, and without her—but you know all
that. Tell me—well, Gregory, I want a good old-fashioned
compliment!”</p>

<p>His voice lost its bantering tone and became formal with
gallantry: “You are, as ever, the handsomest woman in
Montana. I shouldn’t wonder a bit if those New York
reporters were right and that you are the handsomest
woman in America.”</p>

<p>Ida looked for a long moment into his eyes. Again her
brows met in a puzzled frown, this time because her singular
lightness of spirit had fled abruptly. She was too
proud, too far developed beyond the old Ida, to put forth
the arts of the siren until they were alone; but she asked
softly, and again with that almost childish naïveté:</p>

<p>“Do you really admire me?”</p>

<p>“You are all right,” he said with a heartiness that
masked a sudden misgiving. “I must come in and take
you to the theatre the next time a good show comes to
town. Let me know. I’ll gratify my vanity by sitting
beside you in a box——”</p>

<p>“There’s a play tomorrow night. Stay over!”</p>

<p>“I’m sorry. I don’t dare. Apex is sinking for all she’s
worth. We may have a set-to any minute. It was a risk
even to come away for a night.”</p>

<p>“Oh, do let me go out, and down into the mine——”</p>

<p>“I should think not. And do your best to keep Mrs.
Blake in Butte for at least a week.”</p>

<p>“Well, let me go out when the danger is over. I long to
see chalcopyrite in the vein. I saw some beautiful specimens
at the School of Mines the other day. It looks like
pure gold.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">[276]</span>He looked at her in amazement. “What on earth do
you know about ores? Did you include Freiberg in your
itinerary?”</p>

<p>“This is Butte, remember. I no sooner returned than
I realised how interesting she was.”</p>

<p>“Ah, well, when this affair is settled, come out and stay
with Mrs. Blake and I’ll take you down. I’ve no place to
put you up. Even the ranch house is full. Mrs. Blake’s
manager and foreman are boarding there at present, and
Oakley also puts up my secretary——”</p>

<p>“And those crops Oakley put in with such enthusiasm?”
cried Ida with a sudden inspiration, and racking her memory.
“Did they turn out as he expected? Was there a
drought—in—in—those states?”</p>

<p>“What a memory you have! Yes, Oakley is doing wonders,
and the drought arrived as per schedule. He would
scorn to put the ranch under the ditch, although that is
my long suit at present.”</p>

<p>“I suppose Circle-G Ranch looks like Holland by this
time.”</p>

<p>“Not quite yet! But the work is progressing splendidly,
all except——” He paused. It had never been his habit
to talk to her, and the complicated details of business he
regarded as beyond the intelligent apprehension of any
woman. But as Ida moved closer to him with wide-open
eyes she looked intelligent enough to understand anything,
and a letter received that morning had been on his mind
ever since. “There is some trouble about the railroad,”
he said. “The Land Company was to build it, but either
doesn’t want the bother or really has lost a lot of money, as
it claims. I placed a deed in escrow which pledges me to
build it if the Land Company failed to keep its agreement;
and the seed houses, which bought several large blocks of
land, and a number of private settlers are demanding
that the railroad be begun—it was to be finished at the
end of a year——”</p>

<p>Ida saw her opportunity and grasped it. “We both
must do our duty, and not monopolise each other,” she
said hurriedly. “But tell me all about it after they have
gone. Now, go and dance with Kitty Collier. She’s the
best-looking woman in Butte. I can’t dance in this harness,
but I’ll talk English politics with my portlier guests.”
As he smiled and moved toward the music, she laid her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">[277]</span>
hand lightly on his arm. “I want to thank you for coming
tonight, Gregory,” she said. “It means a great deal to
me socially. Besides, it is good to see you again.” And
this time she looked very sweet; but there was a slight
aloofness in her manner, as if to admonish him that, although
he was forgiven, there was still a breach which it
was for him to close. Then she added lightly: “Well,
we’ll talk it all over later. Go, now, and dance.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Gregory stood by the front door talking to two of the
men, whose wives had walked on; their homes were but a
door or two away. Ida ran up the stairs to Ora’s room,
where they unhooked each other.</p>

<p>“You look tired,” said Ida, sympathetically.</p>

<p>“Oh, I am tired,” replied Ora, her arms hanging.
“Tired. Tired.”</p>

<p>“It’s a long while since you danced like that. Just
drop into bed. Lend me a scarf, will you?”</p>

<p>She covered her opened gown with the lace and walked
slowly over to her room. Then she suddenly turned back
to the head of the stairs. The three men were still talking
below.</p>

<p>“Gregory,” she called, and her voice was very sweet.</p>

<p>“Yes?”</p>

<p>“Lock up, will you? The servants have gone to bed.”</p>

<p>“I will.”</p>

<p>“Don’t forget,” and omitting to add a good-night, she
went swiftly to her room, changed her formal evening
gown for a soft combination of yellow silk and lace that
made her look like a tulip in a primrose bed, let down the
black masses of her hair, and threw herself into a deep
chair. But there was no repose in her attitude. More
than once her body stiffened and she raised her head.
Pride and shrewdness forbade her to leave her door open,
and it would be impossible to hear that light panther-like
tread on the heavy carpet of the stair. The front door
might have closed while she was changing in the dressing-room.</p>

<p>Suddenly she heard it slam. Nervous as she was she
smiled reminiscently. Gregory might be soft of foot, but
otherwise he was as noisy as most men. Then the smile
froze until her lips were distended in a grin. Another
door had slammed. Gregory was in his own room.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">[278]</span>After a few moments she became aware that her body
was rigid and that she was grasping the arms of her chair.
She rose with an exclamation of impatience, but stood
with her head bent, listening intently. Suddenly she
swayed a little, once more flooded with that sense of excited
gladness with which guests and chefs had had naught
to do: she thought she heard a door open softly, a light
footfall. But her straining ear-drums had deceived her.
The house was as still as a mausoleum. She pressed her
hands against her breast in the gesture the stage has borrowed
from life; her heart felt as if swimming against an
undertow.</p>

<p>Then she began pacing up and down. After her habit
she tried to arrange her thoughts by putting them into
words, and, as people still do off the stage, muttered them
aloud.</p>

<p>“My God! Do I care as much as that? Do I really
<i>care</i>? No! No! No! Any woman of pride, let alone
vanity, would make up her mind to bring her husband
back—especially if she could make him as proud of her
as I made him of me tonight. And when he still thinks
me beautiful. What woman wouldn’t? Even if she didn’t
have an ounce of any kind of feeling for him? Men are
only interesting when they forget about us in that purely
masculine world where women are warned off the grass.
To lure them back—that is the spice of life in this country.
And if one doesn’t succeed the first time—he may be so
tired and sleepy that he’s forgotten about me—or shy,
afraid I’d laugh at him—the world does not come to an
end tonight—What an idiot I am! I made him admire me
more than ever, astonished him—why am I not satisfied
for the present?—It can’t be that I care—that I long for
him to come—Good God! I’d rather be dead than <i>that</i>!”</p>

<p>But she went to the door and, laying her ear against it,
listened until she became aware that her lungs were bursting
with imprisoned breath. Then she sank into a chair
trembling, her eyes filled with fear. A moment more and
she flung her arms over the table and dropped her face
upon them and broke into heavy weeping.</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap">ORA looked round the large living-room of her bungalow
with a deep sense of content. The walls were
covered with a material coarse in weave and of a red warm
but not too bright. The colour was repeated in the divan
and chairs, melting softly into browns that harmonised
with the heavy beams of the ceiling. A few Navajo rugs
covered the floor. Above the divan of many cushions was
a bookshelf crowded with the new fiction of two continents.
Several shelves, built like a bookcase, occupied a corner
and were furnished more ponderously. In the middle of
the room a large table was half covered with the best
periodicals of the day, although there was room for a
large lamp with a red shade and a vase filled with wild
flowers. Down at the far end of the room, which was
about thirty feet long, and opposite the kitchen, were the
dining-table and a small sideboard. The main door
opened upon a verandah, and one beside the fireplace into
a narrow hall, giving privacy to the bedrooms. Ora had
no atavistic yearnings for the life of the pioneer; she might
feel as much at home in a bungalow as in a palace, but
elementals, save when pictorially valuable, like overhead
beams, were rigidly excluded.</p>

<p>Her hands clasped behind her, she drifted up and down
the long room, her mode of ambulation expressing the state
of her mind. Quick and final as she could be in decision,
if necessity spurred, the deeper sensuousness in her nature
impelled her to drift whenever circumstances would permit.
For two months she intended to drift—or gamble!
She had not come out here further to alienate the affections
of her friend’s husband, and those old tumultuous dreams
were still crowded in some remote brain cell with seals
on the door. She had even told herself in so many words
that she had no desire for anything so terrific as their
complete materialisation. She had plumbed the depth and
intensity of life in her imagination. Let that suffice. And<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">[280]</span>
reality was not so much to be feared because of the wreck
it might make of her life as because it was reasonably
sure to leave a corpse in her memory, instead of that ever
burning soul of past delights.</p>

<p>But she had come out to her mine to enjoy the constant
companionship of Gregory Compton before she left her
country for ever and married a European. That much she
owed to the extraordinary imaginative experience in which
they had been one. If she could spend long hours with
him, make him as eager for her companionship as she was
for his, forget his mine now and then, feel that mysterious
and satisfying bond of the spirit, she would ask no more,
not even an admission of love when they parted.</p>

<p>When a woman goes on a still hunt for a man’s soul she
is far more dangerous than the obvious siren, for her self-delusion
is complete, her guards are down, her wiles disarming.
Ora had had too little practical experience of men
to be prepared to admit, in spite of her abstract knowledge
of life, that there has been but one foundation of love since
the world began, and never will be another till life on this
planet ends, whatever may be the starry mysteries of the
spheres. But while she was (spasmodically) too honest to
deny even her own sex encumbrance, she believed, like
many other, particularly American women of narrow experience,
that it had been politely emasculated by the
higher civilisation, was merely synonymous with poetry,
romance, and sentiment. This convention was imported
to the New World by England’s middle-class and became
a convenient national superstition. It is on the wane.</p>

<p>That Gregory, granted she were successful in capturing
his soul, might desire to contribute the rest of himself to
the spoils, now that she no longer was the wife of his
friend, let loose those subversive passions she had divined
the night of their meeting and dared to recognise in the
realm of imagination, she would have refused to admit had
the possibility occurred to her. She was out for the ideal,
and not yet had she learned to take her imagination in
hand like a refractory child. Moreover, she had an imperious
will, gracefully as she concealed it. This last year
of freedom and wealth and feminine triumphs had tempered
that will into a pliable and dangerous weapon.
What she wanted she would have. As she planned a thing
so should it work out. But the details—ah, they were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">[281]</span>
veiled in the future, and from their mysteries came this
reflex vibration, this pleasant sense of drifting, of wondering
how it would all begin and what would happen next.</p>

<p>In a sense it had begun. Gregory had called two days
before to ask if she were comfortable. He was in his overalls
(purposely), and had refused at first to sit down, but
finally had succumbed to the deepest of the chairs before
the log fire. He had finished by remaining for supper,
and again had occupied the chair until eleven o’clock.
Neither had suspected the other’s secret passion, for love
before union, being nine parts imagination, needs solitude
for indulgence, and is capable, moreover, of long and
satisfying quietudes if fed with externals. There was
sheer delight in sitting together by that warm intimate
fire, at the dining-table at the end of the long shadowy
room, in feeling cut off from the world on the edge of
that rough mountain camp, in listening to the soughing
of the pines during the silences. That both were on their
guard lest the other take fright and the experience be
impossible of repetition but exaggerated the atmosphere
of friendliness, of almost sexless comradeship. Gregory
betrayed one only of his reflections: he admitted to himself
what Ora subtly compelled him to admit, and had no difficulty
in divining, that the companionship of woman was a
blessed thing, and that he had been the loneliest of men.</p>

<p>Their talk was mainly of ores! She was permitted to
learn how little else interested him in comparison with the
enthralling inside of Montana. But he told her also the
legends of the great copper mines on Lake Superior, so
old that copper was found pure, looking much like the
smelted product from the copper ores of the later geological
formations of the Rocky Mountains. These vast mines,
particularly that on Isle Royal, bore unmistakable signs
of having been worked systematically by a prehistoric
people experienced in mining; presumably by the Atlantans,
who, after their own mines were worked out and
they still demanded “orichalcum” for their monuments
and bronze for their implements, went annually in ships for
the metal. That there had been a self-supporting mining
colony on Isle Royal was indicated by certain agricultural
remains.</p>

<p>Gregory and Ora had amused themselves reconstructing
that old time when the metal island was as lively as today,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">[282]</span>
and considerably more picturesque—owing to the alternative
of skins for muck-spattered overalls; an underground
chapter of the Niebelungenlied, its gnomes toiling
down in those two miles of workings, stoping out less in
a hundred years than the methods of today force a mine
to yield in one. How they must have swarmed to the surface,
regardless of discipline, at the first signal of the
approaching ships, their one link with a world that was
not all water and forest and underground cavern. By
what tortuous way did those archaic ships travel from the
Atlantic to the northwest corner of that vast inland sheet;
unless, indeed, which is likely, subsequent upheavals have
destroyed a waterway which may have connected sea and
lake prior to 10000 B.C.<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[B]</a> How many of those old ships
lie in the bed of Lake Superior, laden with rude nuggets
of copper, pounded from the gangue, or, who knows?
smelted by a lost art into sheets and blocks? Archaic
ships rode high, and no doubt those from Atlantis were
overladen; for what has kept Atlantis in the realm of
myth so long save the unscientific legend that she perished
of greed and its vicious offspring? What archaic mysteries
may not the terrible storms of that great north lake yet
uncover? What strange variety of copper, washed and
bitten by the waters of twelve thousand years, for which
the enraptured geologist must find a new name? Who
knows?—the bed of Lake Superior may be one unbroken
floor of malachite; and the North American Indian of
that region the descendant of those ancient miners, abandoned
and forgotten when Atlantis plunged to the bottom
of the sea.</p>

<p>It was Ora who advanced these last frivolous theories,
and—the clock striking eleven—Gregory sprang to his feet.</p>

<p>“Likely as any,” he said. “All theories change about
as often as it is time to get out a new edition of an encyclopædia,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">[283]</span>
or develop a ‘new school’ which makes its reputation
by the short cut of upsetting the solemn conclusions
of its predecessors. I’m going down into the mine.” He
bolted out with no further ceremony, but Ora was long
since accustomed to the manners of Western men. She
went to bed feeling that sadness had gone out of the world.</p>

<p>She had not seen him since. Nor had anything new and
interesting happened. Her manager, Raymond, refused to
take her down in the mine, alleging that when Apex broke
into the workings of Perch of the Devil, there was sure
to be a fight, and the bohunks would retreat, not up their
own shaft but through the tunnels of the Primo mine.
The young man was manifestly distressed to refuse any
boon to so charming a woman, and he and his foreman
had moved at once into the half-finished cottage, but he
heartily wished her back in Butte, nevertheless. The best
of miners love a fight, and it would be impossible to protect
her from flying bullets if the row was continued above
ground. Ora merely had laughed when he begged her to
return or to remain within doors, but had promised to be
prudent and flourished her automatic .25.</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap">SHE glanced at the clock. It was half-past three. She
knew that Gregory frequently went below in the
morning, and had half expected that he would cross over
to her hill for a moment when he came up at three o’clock.
The drifting mood vanished. She decided that two days
were enough for feminine passivity and went to her bedroom
and changed her pretty house frock for a stout out-of-doors’
costume of forest green tweed: as she had no
mind to look either the outworn Western heroine of romance,
or a fright, she had omitted khaki from her mountain
wardrobe. She tied a light green veil round her
head, put on a pair of loose chamois gloves, selected a
green parasol lined with pink, and went out to give the
fates a gentle shove.</p>

<p>Hitherto she had so far yielded to the solicitude of her
manager as to take her walks through the pine woods
above her bungalow, but today she marched deliberately
through her grove and stood for several moments on the
edge of the little bluff above the tableland on which her
claim was located. It was her first prolonged look at the
three mining camps, for she had arrived at night. She
had driven out occasionally to mining camps with her
father, once or twice with Mark; the scene was both typical
and picturesquely ugly. In or near the centre of each
claim was the shaft house; fifty feet beyond—the distance
prescribed by law to prevent overhead fires from communicating
with underground timbers—were the buildings containing
the hoisting machinery and the compressed air
plant. Scattered about were the shacks of the miners,
the long bunk- and mess-houses, blacksmith and carpenter
shops. Just below the Apex claim, and on Government
land, an enterprising publican had established himself.
On all sides were other claims of recent location, for there
had been the inevitable rush.</p>

<p>The rude buildings were grey and weather-beaten, and
all traces of the gentle spring verdure had disappeared.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">[285]</span>
About the collar of each shaft was an immense dump heap,
waste rock brought up from the depths, and the highest
of these was on Perch of the Devil. Near each were the
ore bins, but these for the most part were empty, and,
save on the De Smet hill, there was a notable absence of
“double-sixes.” The Primo vein had not been recovered,
Apex had not yet touched bottom; Gregory Compton, for
reasons best known to himself, had changed his original
plan and was merely uncovering his new vein, taking out
as little of its ore as possible. His bins were furnished
with ore from the second level of his mine, where work
had proceeded steadily on the original vein.</p>

<p>The men off shift were standing about in groups as
they did in Butte, or passing in and out of the saloon.
And the racket was deafening: the roar of the machinery
in the hoisting and compressor houses, the crash of rock
dumped from the buckets or skips, the ringing of hammer
on anvil. The scene was not beautiful but it was alive!
One could fancy the thrill of the hidden metals, knowing
that their hour, after vast geological ages of waiting, was
come; that, like mortals, they were to agonise in the crucible
of life and achieve their ultimate destiny.</p>

<p>Ora walked through the grove until she was beyond the
long mess-house at the back of her claim, climbed over the
abrupt rise of Apex—which, combined with the hardness
of the rock, had made its task so long—and, ascertaining
that the larger buildings hid her, crawled under the De
Smet fence, and drew a long breath as she set her feet
squarely on the famous Perch of the Devil. Here the
buildings, large and small, were scattered up to the brow
of the hill and over on the other side. It had, in fact,
something of the appearance of a growing village with
irregular streets; and before several of the cabins children
were playing, or women took their Monday washing from
the line. The fronts of some of these cottages were painted
white, and here and there flowers grew in boxes. There
were even a reading-room and a large “general store.” Altogether
Perch of the Devil looked as if it might grow
larger, and more solid and permanent of aspect, with the
years.</p>

<p>Ora walked through the crooked streets on the steep
hillside until she reached the deep chamber into which
had leached the acids of the centuries to enrich the ores,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">[286]</span>
and incidentally Gregory Compton. Thousands of tons of
dump made a hill in itself and shut off the view to the
south, but below were the acres of waving wheat, the
alfalfa with its purple flower, the sprouting flax, the
winding creek that was often dry but sometimes wet, the
brush sheds for the cattle, the substantial farm buildings.
The broad peaceful expanse looked as if even a winter
wind had never shaken it, so entirely did it seem dissociated
from the frantic energies of its northeast corner.
And still beyond was perfect beauty: the massive pine-covered
mountains, rising tier above tier, ridges of the great
Rockies, far away and up to the sky-cutting line, glittering
with eternal snows. For a few moments Ora forgot
the raucous noises about her, Nature delivering herself of
her precious children with loud protesting pains. Then
she turned suddenly and looked upward.</p>

<p>Gregory had just stepped from his cabin. For a moment
he did not see her, but stood staring, his hands in his
pockets, at the distant mountains. He wore his favourite
overalls and a battered cap on the back of his head; but
he looked so remote in spirit from that materialising costume
that Ora watched him with a sensation of helpless
jealousy. Not for a moment could she delude herself that
he was thinking of her. He looked like a seer.</p>

<p>“Can you see right into the heart of those mountains?”
she asked lightly, as she walked up the hill toward him.
“You looked as if your imagination were ‘blocking out’
thousands of tons of gold quartz.”</p>

<p>He started and coloured, but smiled with a sudden
pleasure at the charming picture in the foreground.
“Something like that. This mine is all right, and now
that I’ve got over my disappointment, I have a feeling
for it that I guess I’ll never have for another mine—something
like the affection for one’s first born! But all
the same I intend to have a gold mine one of these days.
Have you been admiring my view?”</p>

<p>He had walked down and joined her.</p>

<p>“Yes, but that is not what I came over here for. Nor
is it what I came out to the mines for. I brought a small
library, but I find I am not in the humour for books. I
want to be doing something myself. Mr. Raymond won’t
take me down into my mine. I want to go down into
yours—now.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">[287]</span>He hesitated a moment. “Well—why not? Apex is
not working this afternoon—something the matter with
their compressor. They sounded pretty close to our workings
this morning, but the men quit about one o’clock,
and as they didn’t blast it was probably because the holes
weren’t deep enough. I’ve just been told that they can’t
get to work again before tomorrow. But you look much
too fine!”</p>

<p>“Everything cleans; and I’ll leave my veil and parasol
in the shaft house.”</p>

<p>“All right,” he said abruptly. “Come along.”</p>

<p>When they were in the shaft house he asked, “Will you
go down in the skip or by the ladder?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I couldn’t possibly do anything so ignominious as
to go down in a bucket, and I’m very agile. How far
is it?”</p>

<p>“A hundred feet. I shall only take you to the first
level.”</p>

<p>Ora peered down into the black and slanting and apparently
bottomless well. A ladder was built flat against
one side. A skip full of ore was banging against the sides
of the other compartment on its way up. She looked
again at the ladder, shuddered, and set her teeth.</p>

<p>Gregory put two candles in his pocket, inserted his long
limber body into the narrow aperture and ran down sideways.</p>

<p>“Oh!” gasped Ora. “I can’t do that. Please wait.
I—I think I’d better go down backward.”</p>

<p>“By all means. Sit down and turn round. I’ll catch
hold of one of your feet and put it on a rung. The rest
will be easy.”</p>

<p>Ora followed these instructions gingerly, concluding
that the skip would have been more dignified. Then she
forgot dignity and only wondered if her bones had gone
out of her: she had rolled over on her equatorial zone and
was kicking helplessly in the void. But as Gregory caught
her feet and planted them safely she set her teeth once
more and summoned her pride.</p>

<p>“Glad you have on stout boots,” he said, practically.
“We’ve not enough water in the mine for pumps, but it’s
a little damp underfoot. Wait a minute while I light a
candle.” He struck a match and performed this feat;
how, Ora could not even guess; but she glanced down sideways<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">[288]</span>
and saw that he was holding the lighted candle up
at arm’s length.</p>

<p>“Come on,” he said. “You mustn’t be frightened.”</p>

<p>“I’m not a bit frightened, but don’t go too fast.”</p>

<p>Gregory, who was running down the ladder, moderated
his pace, and sent up an occasional word of cheer. Suddenly
Ora heard a horrid noise below like the crash and
roar of an express train. “Has the mine fallen in?” she
gasped.</p>

<p>“Hope not. That’s the tram with ore and rock for the
skip. By and by we’ll use the waste rock to fill up the
stopes with, but we’re only blocking out at present.”</p>

<p>“How frightfully interesting mining is—in all its details!”
Ora’s hands were smarting, and every part of
her, not excluding her imagination, felt as if on the rack.
“That noise is over!”</p>

<p>“Did I hear you say ‘Thank heaven’?”</p>

<p>“Of course not. How much farther is it? Haven’t
we passed the first level?”</p>

<p>“If we had I should be carrying you. Only about
twenty feet more.”</p>

<p>And a few moments later, with the deepest sigh of
relief she had ever drawn, she was standing in the small
station beside the shaft.</p>

<p>“It’s hard work the first time,” he said sympathetically.
“But you’ll soon get used to it.”</p>

<p>“How dark it is!”</p>

<p>“I’ll put in electricity when my troubles with Amalgamated
are over.” He lit another candle and handed it to
her. “Be careful of your frock.”</p>

<p>The ore car was rumbling away in the distance. Gregory
followed the sound down the tunnel and Ora kept
close at his heels. “I suppose we’ll see something after a
while?” she ventured. “I can’t see even you now, only
your candle.”</p>

<p>“We’ll soon be out of this,” he said cheerfully. “You
see, we’ve had to walk under the chamber from which I
took that great deposit of carbonates, and then some——”
He paused a moment, but not before he had turned acutely
to the left. “This is where I lost the vein. We are in
the fault now. How would you like to be in an earthquake
that broke a vein in two and hurled one end——”
His voice was lost in the rattling roar of the compressed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">[289]</span>
air drills, although there was nothing to be seen until they
reached another little station and faced a wider drift on
the right, some twelve feet long. Candles were flaring
from the miners’ candlesticks, whose long points were
thrust into stulls or the softer part of the rock, and four
men were manipulating two of the cumbersome air drills
which stood on tripods. Gregory made a sign to the shift
boss, who shut off a valve, and the din stopped abruptly.</p>

<p>“Now,” said Gregory. “This is what you have come
for.” He moved his candle along the brassy glitter of
chalcopyrite in the vein, steadying her with his arm, for
the floor was uneven and littered.</p>

<p>Ora trembled. She forgot the arm about her; it felt
like mere steel for that matter; she was in one of the
magic caverns of her dreams and she thrilled to the magnet
of the ores. “It looks like pure gold,” she whispered.</p>

<p>“So it is in a sense, and far more beautiful to look at
in the vein.” They had been standing near the opening
of the drift. He guided her down toward the farther
end; the miners made way for them and went out to the
station nothing loath; owing their lives to what has cost
many a man his life and more, the caprice of a woman.</p>

<p>“I want to show you how the holes look before we put
the sticks of powder in,” Gregory began, as he waved his
candle once more aloft, this time over a less dazzling surface.
He stopped abruptly. She felt his body stiffen.
Then, as he whirled her about, he screamed to the men:</p>

<p>“Get out! Run!”</p>

<p>Ora had the sensation of being swept along by a bar of
steel burrowing into the flesh of her waist. But in another
instant she had lost all sense of her body. There
was a shock as if something had hit the hill at its foundations,
a dull roar, and then the crash of falling rock behind
them.</p>

<p>The men were all ahead. Ora dimly could see them
running like rabbits up the fault drift. Then she became
conscious of the stifling sickening smell of powder and a
bursting sensation in her head. No one paused for a
second, nor drew breath until all had turned the corner
and were in the main level. For a space nothing was
heard but the hoarse effort to refill tormented lungs. The
men leaned against the walls of the tunnel. Ora leaned
against Gregory. All sense of fear had departed out of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">[290]</span>
her. She had had her baptism of fire and doubted if she
ever should be capable of the sensation of fear again.</p>

<p>The silence lasted but a moment. Out of the intense
darkness flew oaths like red-hot rocks from boiling
craters.</p>

<p>“Shut up!” said Gregory sharply. “There’s a lady
here. And light up if you have any extra candles. I’ve
dropped mine. We must find out if anybody is missing.”</p>

<p>“I held on to mine,” said Ora proudly. Gregory lit it,
and the shift boss counted his men. “All here, sir; but
by jink, it was a narrow squeak. The—the—the——”</p>

<p>“Never mind—who’s this?” A man was running toward
them from the direction of the shaft.</p>

<p>“It’s me, sir.” Gregory recognised Mann’s voice. “I’ve
just got on to what they were up to. There wasn’t a
blamed thing the matter with the compressor. They just
meant to catch us off guard—anybody hurt?”</p>

<p>“All right. How did you find out?”</p>

<p>“I suspicioned something crooked, so I got one of those
damned bohunks drunk and bribed him. They’d put in
the sticks before they quit, pretending the compressor had
gone wrong and they couldn’t finish drilling. I suppose
they sneaked back while I was getting the story, and lit
the fuses.”</p>

<p>“You’ll let us get back at ’em, boss?” demanded the
men.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes,” said Gregory, in a voice of deadly irony.
“We’ll get back at them.”</p>

<p>He was holding the candle. Ora saw him bend his head
forward in the attitude so characteristic of him. But he
raised it in a moment.</p>

<p>“Go up, every one of you,” he said, “and down to the
saloon. Talk about what happened, but assume that it
was an accident. Any fighting above ground and you’ll
be canned. Say that there’s a big cave-in and we’re
obliged to quit work on this level for the present. See
that that spreads all over Apex camp. Say that I’ve
given you the rest of the shift off. Come down as soon as
you’ve had your drink and said your say. Jerry”—to
the shift boss—“you watch the Apex shaft house. I don’t
figure that they’ll go down under an hour, on account of
the smoke, but if they do just drop below. I’ll wait for
you here. And before you come,” he added grimly, “go<span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">[291]</span>
over to the compressor house and tell them to turn the
steam on the air line.”</p>

<p>“Hooray!” The shouting of the men made almost as
much noise in the tunnel as the recent explosion. “That’s
the ticket, boss. Oh, we won’t do a thing to them!”</p>

<p>“Get out of this,” said the shift boss. “Don’t take
more than one drink; and hold on to your tempers, or
there’ll be no fun below.”</p>

<p>A moment later Gregory and Ora were alone in the
tunnel.</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap">“HOW did you guess?” asked Ora.</p>

<p>“I didn’t guess. I saw a drill hole just beyond
where my men were working. I also did a little quick
deduction. Miners blast just before they go off shift.
The afternoon change of shift is at three o’clock. As I
told you I had seen the Apex men come up about one
o’clock when their compressor stopped. That hole not
only told me that they were closer than we had thought,
but that they were up to devilment. I guessed that they
had timed to blast just before we were ready to drill at
that point. Were you very much frightened?”</p>

<p>“I didn’t like it.” Ora knew that bravery in woman
makes no appeal to the lordly male. “But I hardly had
time to think; and after all you left me nothing to do.”</p>

<p>“Well, you were game and didn’t scream or cry,” he
conceded handsomely. “Let’s light up.”</p>

<p>They had walked as far as the station at the foot of
the shaft. Gregory unlocked the door of a small cupboard,
found two candles and inserted them in miners’
candlesticks that were stabbed into the walls. They flickered
in the draft as a skip rattled up from the second
level, but relieved the oppressive darkness.</p>

<p>“Why, your hair is down!” exclaimed Gregory.</p>

<p>Ora put up a hand. “So it is! Well—I am sure I never
should know if my hair fell down at a good play, and
ours was live drama. I’ll braid it and put on my veil up
above.”</p>

<p>He watched her for a moment as she sat on a box braiding
her long fair hair, vaguely recalling the legend of
the Lorelei. He noticed that her eyes as she peered up at
him looked green in that uncertain light. But in a moment
his thoughts wandered from her. He folded his arms
and stared downward.</p>

<p>Ora leaned back against the wall. She saw that he had
forgotten her, but had made up her mind to accept him as
he was; she had no more desire to dictate his moods than<span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">[293]</span>
to read in advance the book of the next two months.
There was the same pleasurably painful vibration in her
nerves as on the night when she had piled stake upon stake
at Monte Carlo. From that scene her thoughts travelled
naturally to Valdobia and she suddenly laughed aloud.</p>

<p>“What are you laughing at?” demanded Gregory suspiciously.</p>

<p>“I was trying to imagine that we were imprisoned in
the underground dungeon of an Italian palace in the
middle ages.”</p>

<p>“Hard work, I should think. Although if we had a
cave-in I guess the results would be about the same.”</p>

<p>“And you? Were you seeing your minerals winking
three thousand feet below?”</p>

<p>He laughed then, and sat beside her. “At all events
the mystery down there is more romantic than your
mediæval dungeons—and so will the great underground
caverns be when the ores have been taken out.”</p>

<p>“Pity the caverns—stopes!—have to be filled up with
débris to prevent the mine caving in,” said Ora flippantly.
“I went underground in Butte last week—to the
eighteenth level of the Leonard. Nothing but endless
streets and cross-alleys, all numbered——”</p>

<p>“And you didn’t find that interesting?” he asked indignantly.
“To be a third of a mile below the surface
of the earth and find it laid out like a city, with streets
and rooms, and stations ten times as large as this, and
lighted with electricity?”</p>

<p>“Yes, but the knowledge that you have a third of a mile
of those streets and rooms—seventeen levels of them—on
top of you, supported only by waste rock in the stopes, and
timbers that are always snapping in two from the terrific
pressure—timbermen working at every turn—‘Save
YOURSELF’ the first thing you see when you leave that
cage—Oh, well, I felt there was quite enough romance on
top of the earth.”</p>

<p>“I am deeply disappointed in you. You told me once—why,
even lately——”</p>

<p>“Oh, I haven’t changed the least little bit. Nothing in
life,” and she looked at him with laughing eyes, “interests
me as much at present as these two mines. But I am
thankful that we are still within a reasonable distance of
the surface. I am quite content to screw up my eyes and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">[294]</span>
wander in fancy among the primary deposits close to the
central fires. If I had a mine like yours, full of the beautiful
copper ores instead of that hideous pyroxenite of
mine, I should leave a glittering layer in every stope, support
the roof with polished stone columns, light with
hidden electric bulbs, and wander from one to the other
imagining myself in Aladdin’s palace.”</p>

<p>“A fine practical miner you would make. It’s lucky
that your mine is pyroxenite, not quartz. That is if you
want to live in Europe.—Do you?”</p>

<p>“Of course. What have I in this part of the world?
A mine cannot satisfy a woman for ever. I suppose you
wouldn’t care if you never saw a woman again!”</p>

<p>“Oh!” He was looking hard at her.</p>

<p>“What else were you thinking of just now?” asked
Ora, with that perverse desire to be superficial which so
often possesses American women in decisive moments.</p>

<p>He sighed impatiently. “I’ve got a big job on my
hands, one that will take me away from here more or less.
Did Mark tell you of a land deal I put through?”</p>

<p>“I should think so!”</p>

<p>“Well, I’ve got to build that railroad. Apex will close
down when it finds I won’t let its men work underground.
Amalgamated’s next move will be to bring suit for apex
rights, and get out an injunction to enjoin me from working
on that vein until the case is decided. As soon as I
have driven them out now, however, I must get to work
on the railroad—find my engineers—Oh, there are too
many details to bother you with. But it means that I
must spend a good deal of time in Butte until the thing
is started——”</p>

<p>“How delighted Ida will be!” interrupted Ora softly.
“And that house will be so comfortable after your cabin.”</p>

<p>For a moment he did not speak. Nor did his face betray
him; but she fancied that his muscles stiffened. He replied
suavely: “I should have gone on to say that it is
more likely I shall have to attend to the matter in Helena.
That is the centre of the land interest. It is doubtful if
I could find the sort of men I want in Butte.”</p>

<p>“Have you any other land schemes on hand?”</p>

<p>“Not at present.”</p>

<p>“What does that mean?”</p>

<p>“Well—when I have taken a couple more millions out<span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">[295]</span>
of this hill I shall begin to buy land, put it under the
ditch, build the short railroads that may be necessary, and
sell to small farmers—in other words push along the
colonisation of this state. I believe you gave me that idea—the
night we talked Butte—the first time, I mean.”</p>

<p>“I thought you had forgotten that night altogether.”</p>

<p>“Forgotten it!” Ora’s heart stood still at the explicit
vibration in his well-ordered voice. She leaned back and
closed her eyes. He had loved her all these months, dreamed
of her as she had dreamed of him. Her first sensation
of wonder and delight was succeeded by a faint disappointment.</p>

<p>She had the instinct of the born huntress, although she
was far too highly civilised to have recognised it before.
She wondered if his capitulation meant her own deliverance,
too ignorant in the ways of love to guess that
whether this were a passing or a permanent phase depended
on the man.</p>

<p>While Gregory hurried on to tell her of all he should
be able to do for Montana with the millions at present
locked in the vaults of his hill, she had a full moment of
honesty, and confessed that she had come out here to make
Gregory Compton love her. And he did! It was a mighty
personality to conquer; and the victory had been won long
since! But the disappointment passed in a cynical smile.
That he had no intention of declaring himself her lover
was as patent as his inhuman power of self-control. Here
were barricades to storm if barricades she wanted? What
difference? And did she?</p>

<p>He sprang to his feet and stood at the foot of the shaft,
looking up.</p>

<p>“They’re coming down,” he said.</p>

<p>Joshua Mann emerged a moment later.</p>

<p>“Apex bunch being rounded up to go below,” he said.
“Our men are on the way.”</p>

<p>“Steam on the air line?”</p>

<p>“You bet!”</p>

<p>“Let’s get to work.” He turned to Ora. “Stay here
till I come back,” he said peremptorily. “I can’t take
you up in the skip now.”</p>

<p>“I am quite comfortable,” said Ora, coolly. “How
many men will come down?”</p>

<p>“Five.” And he and Mann disappeared into the tunnel.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">[296]</span>Ora waited until the other men had descended one by
one and run into the blackness. Then she dislodged one
of the candlesticks from the wall and ran after them.
When she reached the fault drift she thrust the long point
of the candlestick into a stull before turning the corner.
Then she crept toward the station, from which she could
witness the punishment about to be inflicted upon the
Apex men, whatever it might be.</p>

<p>There was a glimmer of light in the new drift. Ora
saw the men binding a piece of hose to the same length of
pipe. They attached the hose to the air line and held it
just inside the ragged hole some twelve feet above.</p>

<p>There was a distant murmur of voices overhead and to
the right. The solitary candle was extinguished. The
murmur of voices in the drift which led from Apex
shaft along the continuation of the Primo vein grew
louder. Men were laughing. One man was giving orders.
It appeared that they were to let themselves down and
go systematically to work on the Perch vein, which was
now driving under the Apex claim.</p>

<p>Ora heard a sharp whispered word: “Now!” and barely
recognised Gregory’s voice. A second later and she was
deafened by the roar and hiss of escaping steam, mingled
with shrieks of agony above, and fiendish cat-calls and
jeers below, all expressed in the spectacular profanity of
the mining camp. The episode was over in a moment.
The Apex men tumbled over one another in their anxiety
to leave the scene, and those manifestly disabled—Ora
could hear them gasping horribly as the steam was turned
off abruptly—were dragged away. She felt her own way
rapidly along the fault drift, snatched her candlestick
from the wall as she turned the corner, and scampered
back to the shaft station. When the men arrived she was
sitting demurely on the box. Gregory evidently had telephoned
from the other station, for the skip came rattling
down just before his appearance at the head of his laughing,
cursing column.</p>

<p>“Did it go off well?” asked Ora.</p>

<p>“Did it?” cried Mann, tossing his cap in the air.</p>

<p>“They’re settled for the moment,” said Gregory.
“They’ll come back at us later with steam on their own
air line, and slacked lime; but we’ll be ready for them.
They stand no show.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">[297]</span>Two of the men had been left on watch. Gregory lifted
Ora into the skip. He and Mann stood on the edge. A
second more and Ora was holding her breath as they were
hurtled upward at express speed, the metal car banging
from side to side of the shaft. In something under three-quarters
of a minute Gregory helped her to alight in the
shaft house, while the skip descended for the miners.</p>

<p>“Well,” he said, smiling, as she lifted her braid to the
top of her head and wound the veil about it, “have you
supped full of sensations for one day?”</p>

<p>“The last was the worst! And I do mean the skip.
Now that we are where you cannot beat me I will confess
that I followed you and saw your neat little mediæval revenge
from the station——”</p>

<p>“Hush!” Gregory glanced about apprehensively, and
drew her outside. “You mustn’t tell anyone else that.
You don’t want to be summoned to the witness stand, I suppose?”</p>

<p>Ora gasped. “I never thought of that.”</p>

<p>“When will women let men do their thinking?” Gregory
looked the primeval male as he scowled down at her.
Nor did he mitigate her alarms with the information that
underground battles seldom were continued in the courts.
“Now, I am going to take you to your cottage, and I want
you to stay there until the trouble is over. The men are
bound to get drunk and fight. Better go to Butte——”</p>

<p>“I won’t.”</p>

<p>“Very well, then, stay in your house.”</p>

<p>“And be bored to death? Besides. I need exercise. I’ll
roam all over the place unless you promise to come to
supper every night and then take me for a walk in the
woods.”</p>

<p>His eyes flickered. “Perhaps your engineer——”</p>

<p>“He’s a mere child. I hate boys. And I must have
exercise.”</p>

<p>He looked at her with apparent stolidity for another
moment, but she knew that he was investigating her expressive
orbs. They expressed nothing that could be construed
as flirtation, coquetry, or personal interest in himself.
He saw himself mirrored there merely as the friend
of her husband and the husband of her friend. “Very
well,” he said curtly and swung on his heel. “I suppose
I must look out for you. Come along.”</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">XII</h3>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">GREGORY had worn a clean suit of overalls into the
mine. He was now spattered from head to foot, including
his face and hands, but he swung along beside
Ora with an unconsciousness of his disreputable appearance
that was quite superb. All the miners of the three
camps’ off shift were gathered about the saloon. As Gregory
appeared the greater number of these men cheered
wildly, but the “dark men,” who stood apart, maintained
an ominous silence.</p>

<p>“Aren’t you afraid they’ll take a shot at you some
night?” asked Ora. “How they must hate you!”</p>

<p>“You don’t go into any business nowadays and put it
over without running the risk of being shot by some sort
of down-and-outer. What’s the sense in worrying? Unless
I’m much mistaken we’ll be rid of that scum inside
of twenty-four hours.”</p>

<p>And he was right. There was another battle underground,
in which more of the Apex men were scalded,
and the Perch men unhurt. Then the Apex men refused
to work, and the mine closed. Gregory was shot at on
the following night, and Joshua Mann was slightly
wounded. Both the Perch and Primo men tumbled out of
bed, hunted down the offenders, and chased them into
Pony, riddling the air with shot and rending it with bloodthirsty
yells. It would be some time before Apex would
be able to hire miners of any nationality willing to trust
themselves between the two belligerent camps. But bohunks—more
recent importations—would return in the
future, if any. These ignorant and friendless South Europeans
can be killed for about two hundred dollars apiece,
whereas it costs several thousands to kill an American,
Cornishman, or Irishman, as he leaves behind him an
equally intelligent family or friends. It was unlikely, in
any case, that high class miners would “take a job” in the
predatory Apex. They not only liked Gregory Compton<span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">[299]</span>
because he was his own manager and worshipped by his
miners, but because he possessed in overflowing measure
the two qualities that the American in his heart of hearts
respects most, luck and bluff.</p>

<p>Amalgamated immediately brought suit against Gregory
Compton, charging not only that the faulted vein apexed
in their claim, but that his original patent was agricultural
and gave him no lateral rights in mining; furthermore,
that a patented claim could not be repatented. This
was a fine legal point and could impoverish several generations
before it was decided.</p>

<p>Gregory paid no attention to this suit beyond issuing
an invitation through the press to eight of the leading
geologists of the United States and Canada to come to
Montana at his expense and make a personal inspection
of the two veins. If they did not agree that the vein on
which he had been working, containing a shoot of chalcopyrite
six feet wide, and of the highest grade, was the
original vein, and the Primo-Apex a mere stringer, or at
most a fork from his, he would let the suit go by default.
The geologists promptly accepted, and it was agreed that
they should all arrive in Butte on the second of June.</p>

<p>Once more Gregory Compton had scored. Scientific
men are normally honest, although the great fees offered to
geologists frequently infuse their judgment with that malleable
quality peculiar to the lawyer under the subtle influence
of his brief. But these men, all of high repute,
would be too afraid of one another, and of the merciless
newspaper men that would accompany them, to deliver
aught but a just verdict. Gregory knew that Amalgamated
was profoundly disconcerted, and that in the face
of public opinion it was improbable that the suit ever
would be brought into court. But they could devil him
meanwhile, and he was enjoined from working on the
recovered vein until the case should be decided. He accepted
the injunction without protest and transferred the
miners, whom he had kept hard at work blocking out until
the last minute, down to the second level of the mine.</p>

<p>“They’ll get a jolt from that quarter, too,” said Gregory
to Ora, and he was not referring to the miners.
“They’ll go on fighting me for years, no doubt, but I’ll
spring some sort of a facer on them every time. They may
have more money, but I have enough.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">[300]</span>“You never feel afraid they may beat you in the end?”</p>

<p>“Beat me?” Gregory’s eyes glittered. “Not unless
they bore a hole in my skull and introduce a microbe that
will devour my brains. I can get ahead of them in more
ways than one. Long before all the ore on the second
level is stoped out I shall be in a position to put up my
own reduction works if they freeze me out of Anaconda
or Great Falls. If I ever go into politics it will be to
fight for a state smelter.”</p>

<p>Ora looked at him speculatively. He was walking up
and down her living-room with a swift gliding motion
peculiar to him in certain moods; his head was a little
bent as if his narrow concentrated gaze were following a
trail.</p>

<p>“I believe you love the fight as much as any part of
it,” she said.</p>

<p>“I do. And as soon as I’ve taken out money enough
I’m going to buy a big tract of land, irrigate it, plant it
in beets, put up a sugar refinery and fight the Havemeyer
trust.”</p>

<p>“Why don’t you form a company, buy your beet land,
and put up the factory now? You could raise all the
money you wanted.”</p>

<p>“No companies or partners for me,” he said curtly.
“What I’ll do I’ll do alone. I want no man’s help and
no man’s money. And I certainly want no other man’s
ideas interfering with mine.”</p>

<p>Ora sighed. He had been away for a week on his railroad
and land business, and during this, their first meeting
since his return, he had talked of nothing save his
mine and the new possibilities of Circle-G Ranch. Investigation
of the soil and timber values of the 35,000 acres
which he had originally hypothecated as a guarantee that
the railroad should be built, but which perforce had reverted
to him when the Land Selling Company had failed
to keep this part of their contract, would be worth, after
proper transportation facilities were insured, not less than
twenty-five dollars an acre. A member of the Land Selling
Company whom he had taken with him had been convinced
of this, and that the soil was peculiarly adapted
to the raising of apples by intensive culture. As soon
as the railroad was built there would be no difficulty in
selling the timber and the rest of the land, and the Company<span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">[301]</span>
had agreed to buy it. His profits would be $875,000,
and the railroad would cost but $300,000.</p>

<p>No wonder, thought Ora, that a man with a business
brain of that calibre had little place in it for woman.
True, he had called her up once from Helena, evidently
seized with a sudden desire to hear her voice, but he had
been interrupted; and the only tangible result had been
to keep her in such a fever of expectancy that she barely
had left the house lest he call her up again and she miss
him. He did not, and her nerves had become so ragged
that she almost had hated him and obeyed the impulse to
pack her trunks and flee to Europe. He had come to see
her within an hour of his return, but, beyond his rare delightful
smile and a hard pressure of the hand, he had
manifestly been too absorbed to feel any personal appeal
beyond her always welcome companionship.</p>

<p>And the next morning he telephoned that he was leaving
for Butte. Ida had reminded him of his promise to
appear in public with her. Mary Garden was to sing that
night and she had taken a box. He had grumbled but
finally agreed to go, as he had business in Butte which
might as well be transacted that afternoon. Ida thanked
him politely and promised him an interesting party at
dinner. Then she called up Ora and invited her, but Ora
declined on the plea of good taste; the story of her impending
divorce was common property, and it was hardly
decent for her to appear in public.</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap">REACTION, after the emotional recognition of the
subtle but certain change that had been wrought in
her unsuspected depths, had filled Ida for many hours
with a sullen rage against Gregory Compton and herself.
But in a day or two the buoyancy of youth and the common
sense, of which she possessed an uncommon store,
asserted themselves, and, while devoting her time to the
small daily distractions of society, her determination to
win back her husband never waned for a moment. She
knew that she must play the waiting game, keep a sharp
eye out for the blessed opportunity and pounce upon it,
but make no attempt to “rush things.”</p>

<p>The day after the Apex mine closed down, she rang him
up and offered her congratulations, told him something of
the excitement in Butte, then rang off before he began to
feel detained. As he passed through Butte later, on his
way to Helena, he could do no less than call on her, and,
to his relief and her secret rage, he found several pleasant
people taking tea in the library. But she showed her
pride in him so frankly that he could not but be flattered,
and talked so intelligently of the undoubted sequel of the
battle underground that he forgot her guests and addressed
his conversation to her. She drew him on to describe
that grim but picturesque episode underground, and
he would have been less than man had he failed to be
sensible of the rise of his chest while surrounded by a
breathless circle of charming women. When they were
about to withdraw tactfully and leave him alone with his
wife, he glanced at his watch, bade them all a hasty good-bye
and bolted out to catch his train. Ida once more had
been able to exhibit to her little world an evidence of the
pleasant understanding between herself and her busy husband,
and got what consolation out of this fact that she
could.</p>

<p>“I can wait,” she thought grimly. “I can wait! I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">[303]</span>
guess patience is my one all-wool-and-a-yard-wide virtue.
I’ll wait!”</p>

<p>She gave several small dinners and a dancing party,
devoted to the new excitement of “ragging,” in which
no one became more proficient than herself. She “went”
harder than ever, and even joined the more extreme
younger set (elegantly known as “The Bunch”) one
night in a progress among the road houses of The Flat,
and danced in the ballroom of the Five Mile House until
dawn. But she had no real taste for this side of life; and
did penance by visiting the Poor Farm and several other
charities under the wing of Mrs. Cameron. Her popularity
on all sides was unchallenged, and not only was she
firmly established in the city of her heart, but Mrs. Cameron
had offered to take a house with her in New York
for the following winter if she cared to mount still higher.
She was gratified and grateful, but she was filled with that
desperate loneliness that only a man can banish.</p>

<p>On the night of the opera she wore black velvet unrelieved
and never had looked handsomer. The neck of
the apparently inseverable gown was cut square, and her
beautiful arms were exposed as far to the top as fashion
permitted; she wore her hair banded closely about her
head, and, at the base of her throat, a barbaric necklace of
dull red and blue stones that she had picked up in an
antiquity shop in Munich. As she sat in her box between
Mrs. Cameron and Mrs. Collier, one of the handsomest
and best dressed of the younger women of Butte, Gregory,
who sat behind and facing the house, saw that during the
first entr’acte the audience levelled its glasses at her
constantly, and that, indisputably, she divided the honours
of the night with the prima donna.</p>

<p>He looked at her more than once himself, her classic
beauty, or the classic effect she made it produce, appealing
to his æsthetic sense as beauty in any form always
did. He wondered a little that it should so have lost its
once irresistible appeal to his senses, wondered again if
he could not still have loved her well enough to live with
had Ora never entered his life. Certainly he was very
proud of her, and her conversation as well as her personality
interested him. He respected her profoundly for
what she had achieved, giving her full credit for the
revolution in appearance, manners, and speech, in spite of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">[304]</span>
her exceptional opportunities. Then he forgot her as his
thoughts wandered to Ora, whom he saw sitting alone in
her warm shadowy room, in which he had come to feel so
much at home. As he always went to her when he was
tired, after a day filled with excitement or hard physical
labour, he experienced only peace and content in her nearness;
but when away, as tonight, and with the music of
Thaïs singing into his keen responsive nerves, he was filled
with an inexpressible longing.</p>

<p>He was roused by a faint exclamation from Ida. She
was leaning forward. A moment later a man, whom he
had never seen before and who looked like an Englishman
of distinction, silently entered the box. Ida left her chair,
and gave him both her hands in greeting, then went with
him out into the passageway where their conversation
would not interfere with her guests’ enjoyment of the
music.</p>

<p>Gregory felt very much like any other husband at that
moment. He was conscious of no sting of jealousy, or
stab of doubt, but he did not like it. He also received a
distinct impression that his rights of proprietorship were
menaced. Moreover, he was so invaded by mere curiosity
that it was with difficulty he refrained from gratifying it
at once. But, although he belonged to the type of Western
man who would shoot the filcher of his woman without an
instant’s consideration, he was the last man in the world
to make a fool of himself.</p>

<p>Ida tried his patience but a few moments. As soon as
the curtain fell she re-entered the box and presented the
stranger as Lord John Mowbray, who had arrived by the
evening train and sought the opera house as a relief from
the hotel. She did not add that he had telephoned at
once to her house and followed her as quickly as he could
change his clothes.</p>

<p>The husband was the last to be made known to the
distinguished stranger, and in spite of Mowbray’s ability
to look vacuous, and Gregory’s to look like a graven image,
neither could repress a spark under his lowered lids.
Mowbray reared his haughty crest at once and turned
away. Like many young Englishman he blushed easily,
and he was by no means the first man to feel uncomfortable
under the eyes of Gregory Compton. He felt the
colour rising to his white forehead, and was not sorry to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">[305]</span>
present his splendid back and length of limb to that searching
gaze.</p>

<p>He sat close to Ida during the last act, and then the
party went to her house to supper, there being no restaurant
worthy the name in Butte. Gregory detained Ida
at the door after the other had entered.</p>

<p>“Good night,” he said. “Luning promised to wait for
me at his office. I shall talk to him until it is time to
catch the train for Pony.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I am so sorry,” said Ida politely, and smiling
charmingly. “So will the others be. And I wanted you
to talk to Lord John. His brother has a ranch in Wyoming,
and he has come here on some mining business. I
am so glad to see him again. The men here are—well, they
are all right, but quite absorbed in one thing only—whatever
their profession or business happens to be. Lord
John knows a little about everything. I am sure you
would like him. Do ask me to take him out to the mine.
He is a friend of Ora’s, too. She will ask us if you don’t.”</p>

<p>“Come whenever you like. If I’m not there my foreman
will show you round. Good night.” And he was
off. Ida, feeling that Mowbray’s arrival had been timed
by Providence, went in to her guests.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">[306]</span>

<h3 class="nobreak">XIV</h3>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">“WHO is this Mowbray?” Gregory asked Ora abruptly
on the following evening. He was in Ora’s living-room,
his long legs stretched out to the fire.</p>

<p>Ora, who was working on a small piece of embroidery in
a frame, superlatively feminine, enveloped in a tea gown
imponderable and white, looked up in surprise. They had
been sitting together for an hour or more and their conversation
had been wholly of his plans to entertain his
party of geologists, and the attention this sensational flank
attack had attracted throughout the country.</p>

<p>“Is Lord John here?”</p>

<p>“Yes. Came into the box last night. Handsome chap.”</p>

<p>“Mowbray is a dear. We saw a great deal of him, and
he bought our tickets and helped us off generally, when
we were so upset over your cable.”</p>

<p>“Ah! Tame cat? General utility man?”</p>

<p>“Hardly! He’s full of life and a charming companion.”</p>

<p>“Hm.”</p>

<p>There was another silence and then he asked abruptly:
“Is he in love with Ida?”</p>

<p>This time Ora dropped her work and sat up rigidly;
her hands turned cold. There was a peculiar alteration
of pitch in Gregory’s voice that might register jealousy in
a hypersensitive ear. And when his face looked most like
a bronze reproduction of itself, his friends deduced that
he was masking emotion.</p>

<p>Ora’s brain always worked swiftly. Was it possible
that by subtle manipulation she could reunite this man
and her friend? That he loved herself she no longer
doubted, but it was equally doubtful if he would ever
confess it; on the cards that if he did he never would see
her again. If she left the country after adroitly re-awakening
his interest in Ida and playing on his vanity
and jealousy, would not reaction, the desire for consolation
and companionship, carry him straight to the wife<span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">[307]</span>
whose beauty and magnetism had once, and not so long
ago, aroused all the ardours of his manhood? Ida was far
more beautiful now, and quite capable of holding any
man. Ora did not for a moment believe that Ida loved
her husband, or never would she herself have returned to
Butte; but she had divined her mortification, her wounded
pride; and as a young and beautiful woman Ida needed
and was entitled to the protection of her husband.</p>

<p>Was this her moment? Her great opportunity? Her
bosom heaved, her breath came short. Almost she experienced
the subtle delights of renunciation, of sacrifice, of
the martyrdom of woman. It would be a great rôle to
play, a great memory. And after all she had Valdobia.
It was this last irresistible reflection that gave her soaring
spirit a sharp tumble and she laughed aloud.</p>

<p>Gregory turned his head and smiled as he met the
cynical amusement in her eyes. “What is it?”</p>

<p>“I was merely commiserating poor Mowbray. Of course
he is more or less <i>épris</i>; but Ida—she hasn’t it in her to
love any man.”</p>

<p>“That is the conclusion I arrived at long ago. But it
looked as if he had followed her here, and I don’t care for
that sort of talk.”</p>

<p>“He had planned to visit his brother in Wyoming before
we met him in Genoa. Don’t worry. Ida never will let
any man compromise her. She’ll parade her son of a duke
for the benefit of Butte, but if he shows signs of getting
out of hand she’ll pack him off.”</p>

<p>“Yes, Ida is too ambitious to compromise herself.”</p>

<p>And then another little arrow flew into Ora’s brain.
Her hands trembled, but she clenched them in her lap.
“Gregory,” she said steadily, “as you and Ida no longer
love each other, why don’t you suggest a divorce? She
could marry Mowbray and have a big position in London—his
brother is almost sure not to marry—is a wreck—Ida
would be quite in her element as a duchess—and you—you
would be free—if you ever wanted to marry again.”</p>

<p>When nature has given a man a dark skin and he has
permitted it to accumulate yearly coats of tan, it is difficult
for him to turn white under the stress of emotion;
but Gregory achieved this phenomenon as he realised
abruptly what freedom might mean to him. He stood up
and leaned his back against the high chimneypiece, thrusting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">[308]</span>
his hands into his pockets; he had long nervous fingers
which sometimes betrayed him when his face was set.</p>

<p>“Ida would never consent to a divorce,” he said heavily.
“She’s got all sorts of old-fashioned American ideals. The
West has the reputation for being lawless, and it’s got
more Puritans to the square inch than are left in New
England. Ida’s one of them.”</p>

<p>“She may have acquired more liberal ideas in Europe.”</p>

<p>“She told me that she didn’t care if she never saw
Europe again. Last night I had quite a long talk with
her before the others came in for dinner. She said she
thought it the duty of Western women—particularly the
women of the newer Northwest—to live in their native
state and only go away occasionally in order to bring
something back to it. She intimated that you put that idea
into her head when you two first met.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, I believe that to be right, whatever I may do,
myself.”</p>

<p>“What is your idea in going to Europe to live? You
are just the sort of woman the West needs.” He bit out
his words in the effort to be calm and casual.</p>

<p>“I don’t feel that I have any place here.”</p>

<p>Gregory started on a restless walk up and down the room.</p>

<p>“Look at here,” he shot out finally, “are you—I haven’t
said anything about it—but—of course I’ve wanted to—are
you determined to leave Mark? He’s one of the best
fellows in the world. I hate to see him thrown down.
You—you—I think you should reconsider.”</p>

<p>“I had done all my considering before I spoke to Mark.
I am doing him the greatest possible kindness. He needs
another sort of woman altogether to make him happy.
And I? Have I not my right to happiness? Do you
think I could find it with Mark?”</p>

<p>“No!” The word exploded. “And you—shall you
marry again?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know.” Ora spoke in a strangled voice. New
possibilities were shaking her to her foundations. For a
moment the perverse imp in the purely feminine section
of her brain counselled her to run away as ever from the
serious mood in man, to play with great issues and then
dodge them. But she brushed the prompting aside with
frantic haste and summoned her courage. If this was
happiness coming to her grasp she would seize it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">[309]</span>Gregory came swiftly back from the farther end of the
room and stood before her. He had set the muscles of the
lower part of his face so tightly that he could hardly open
his mouth, but his narrow eyes were blazing. “If Ida
would give me my freedom,” he said, “I should want to
marry you. Do you understand?”</p>

<p>Ora stood up. Her white face was so radiant that
Gregory fell back. “You love me?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Yes.—Oh, yes——”</p>

<p>“You would marry me?”</p>

<p>“Yes!”</p>

<p>Gregory stared at her, wondering if she really were
suffused with white fire. Her hands fluttered toward him,
and his own face was suddenly relaxed, unmasked. Ora’s
lips parted and she bent forward. She knew then why
men and women sacrificed the world when they found
their predestined mates. Here was the one man who could
give her primal joy, suffocate her intellect. And the
knowledge that she was capable of such passion and of the
sacrifices it might involve gave her far more satisfaction
than her former brief mood of renunciation.</p>

<p>She made another step forward, but Gregory was at
the door. “Talk to Ida!” he said harshly. “I leave it
to you. Go to see her tomorrow. You can do anything
with her. You must!”</p>

<p>And he was out of the house. He left the door open
and Ora could hear his light running footsteps.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">[310]</span>

<h3 class="nobreak">XV</h3>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">ON the following morning Gregory, who had spent the
night in the mine and had just come up to the cabin,
heard his telephone ring as he was about to take his bath
and go to bed. His first impulse was to ignore the summons,
but, his business instinct prevailing, he went into
the office and unhooked the receiver.</p>

<p>“Well?” he asked, in a voice both flat and uninviting.</p>

<p>“It is Ida. How tired your voice sounds. I won’t keep
you a minute. I have a plan to suggest. Why not let me
put up those geologists? Mrs. Cameron has asked me to
stay with her and will come over and help me entertain
them at meals. It will not only save you a fearful hotel
bill but keep them from wandering into the wrong fold.”</p>

<p>“Good idea!” Gregory’s voice was more animated.</p>

<p>“I’ll get Professor Becke to take them down into one
of the big mines here, take them out myself to yours, amuse
them between times with the prettiest women in town—in
short stick to them closer than a brother.”</p>

<p>“Good! You are the right sort. I’ll meet them at the
train—on the night of the second, it is—and take them
right up to your house. It’s putting you to a lot——”</p>

<p>“Not a bit. It will be immense fun. Good-bye.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>On that same morning Ora went to Butte. She had
telephoned to Ida, and Mowbray met her at the train with
the limousine.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Compton had to go to some charity meeting or
other,” he said, as they shook hands warmly. “I am to
drive you about for an hour.”</p>

<p>This was better fortune than Ora, who possessed little of
Ida’s patience and talent for the waiting game, had dared
to anticipate.</p>

<p>“How jolly!” Her face lost its traces of a sleepless
night as it flashed with hope and enthusiasm. “And after
that dreadful train! Drive to the Gardens,” she said to
the chauffeur.</p>

<p>She pointed out Anaconda Hill as they passed under
that famous portal, and the shaft houses of other mines,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">[311]</span>
suggesting that he go down with the geologists when they
made the inevitable descent. “But you will find your
visit to Mr. Compton’s mine more satisfactory,” she added
lightly. “You will see more ore in the vein. How do you
like him?”</p>

<p>Mowbray growled something in his thick inarticulate
English voice, and Ora grasped her opportunity. She
turned to him with the uncompromising directness her
sinuous mind knew so well how to assume.</p>

<p>“Take me into your confidence,” she said peremptorily.
“I can help you. At all events keep you from making
any mistakes with Ida. She is what is called a difficult
proposition. Are you in love with her?”</p>

<p>Mowbray turned a deep brick-red and frowned, but he
answered intelligibly: “You know jolly well I am.”</p>

<p>“Then let me tell you that there is only one way you
can get her. Ida is moral to the marrow of her bones.
You might make her love you, for she and her husband
are practically separated, but you can get her only by
persuading her to divorce Mr. Compton.”</p>

<p>“I’ve thought of that. Of course I’d rather marry her.
I’m a decent sort myself—hate skulking—and lying—she’s
the last woman I’d want to compromise. But I’m so
beastly poor. I’ve only twelve hundred pounds a year.”</p>

<p>“And she has forty thousand pounds now of her own.
You need not hesitate to spend the capital, for Mr. Compton
is most generous, and is sure to give her much more.
He is bound to be a multimillionaire—it is only a question
of a few years.”</p>

<p>“Does he want his own freedom?”</p>

<p>“I am not in his confidence. But as they no longer
care for each other and have agreed to live apart—merely
showing themselves together in public occasionally to avoid
gossip—it is natural to suppose that he would be indifferent,
at least. He cannot be more than thirty, and will
be sure to want his freedom sooner or later.”</p>

<p>“This is splendid of you!” cried the Englishman gratefully.
“She’s not happy. I know that, and now I shall
know just what to do.”</p>

<p>“Sympathise with her. Make yourself necessary—make
her feel the neglected wife, and what a devoted husband
would mean. You have the game in your own hands, and
I will help you.”</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">XVI</h3>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">ORA discerned certain changes in Ida as the three reunited
friends, with so many pleasant memories in
common, talked gaily at luncheon. It was not only that
she was a trifle thinner but there were shadows in her
eyes that gave them troubled depths. The curves of her
mouth also were less assured, and her strong, rather large,
but beautiful hands had a restless movement. Ora, whose
imagination was always ready to spring from the leash
and visualise a desired conclusion, pictured Ida, if not
already in love with this good-looking and delightful Englishman,
as circling close; neglected and mortified, she
longed for the opportunity to live her life with him; in
short was champing the bit.</p>

<p>Ora led the conversation—no great adroitness was necessary—to
the many divorces pending in Butte at the moment.
Ida sniffed. Ora asserted gaily that they were
merely a casual result of an era of universal progress and
individualism; one of the commonplaces of modern life
that hardly called for comment. “You are so up to date
in everything else, my dear,” she concluded, “that I wonder
you cling to such old middle-class prejudices.”</p>

<p>“I guess there are a few conservatives and brakes left
in this country,” said Ida, drily. “I may look back with
horror at the time when I chewed gum and walked out of
a restaurant with a toothpick in my mouth, but Ma hammered
most of my good old-fashioned prejudices into my
back with the broom-handle, and I’m no more likely to
forget her opinion of divorce—the poor get it sometimes
as well as the rich—than the bastings I got if I played
hookey from school, or sneaked out after dark alone with
a beau.”</p>

<p>“My mother was exactly the same,” said Ora, with that
charming spontaneity which so often robbed her words
of the subtle insult of condescension, or the more cryptic
of irony. “If I hadn’t happened to be a book-worm and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">[313]</span>
had indulged in clandestine love affairs I should have been
shut up on bread and water. And she had all a Southern
woman’s horror of divorce. But, dear Ida! That was
in the dark ages. We live in the most enlightened and
individualistic era of the world’s history. I have kept my
eyes and ears open ever since. Nor do I believe for a
moment that we are getting any worse—we merely have
achieved a more well-bred indifference toward other people’s
affairs. One can hear a scandal a minute in large
towns and small, if one has nothing better to do than
listen; but whereas in our mothers’ time a woman was
dropped if she was ‘talked about,’ today we don’t turn a
hair at anything short of a quite superlative divorce court
scandal—not even about girls; always provided that they
continue to dress well, and keep on being charming and
spending money.”</p>

<p>“That is about the most cynical thing I ever heard you
say.”</p>

<p>“The truth always sounds cynical. You laugh at me
for dreaming and being an idealist, but I never have shut
my mind to facts as you do.”</p>

<p>“I don’t even blink the old facts. I don’t like them,
that’s all. I don’t say, of course, that if I were married
to a brute who came home drunk and beat me—but this
swapping husbands like horses—well, I’m content to be a
brake as long as there’s any wheel to freeze to. You know
I’m not hitting at you,” she added hastily. “I’d give you
the moon if you wanted it; but I put you in a class by
yourself, that’s all.”</p>

<p>“Oh,” cried Ora, laughing. “Let us change the subject
before you prove that your logic turns feminine at
the crucial test. Heavens! How hideous Butte is. We
drove——”</p>

<p>“Hideous? Butte?” demanded Ida indignantly.</p>

<p>“Oh, you see it through the glamour of a triumphal
progress. Wait until the novelty has worn off. How do
you find it?” she asked Mowbray, who had relished his
excellent luncheon and admired his ally’s tactics.</p>

<p>“Rippin’ air. Nearly took a header out of the window
this mornin’ thinkin’ I had wings. But as for looks—those
mountains in the distance are not half-bad, but the
foreground is—er—a little ragged—and—new—you
know.” He smiled into Ida’s warning eyes. “Really,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_314">[314]</span>
dear lady, I can understand that you were keen on gettin’
home again, because home is home, don’t you know. But
beauty—tell me just where you do find it.”</p>

<p>Ida tossed her head. “Beauty is in the eye of the
beholder, and mine beholds it. That is enough for me.
Now, run along to the Club. I haven’t seen Ora for ages.
You may come back for tea.”</p>

<p>She led the way up to her bedroom and they made themselves
comfortable and lit their cigarettes.</p>

<p>“Odd as it would seem,” said Ida, “to those east and
west of us who have an idea that Butte has been on one
prolonged spree since she was really a camp, I have to
enjoy my occasional cigarette on the sly. A few of the
younger women smoke, when they have locked the doors
and pulled the blinds down—and of course The Bunch
does; but the majority—and those that never bat an eyelash
at cocktails and champagne—think it indecent for a
woman to smoke. Funny world.”</p>

<p>“Butte is a provincial hole. As there are no strangers
present you needn’t bother to defend it. I’ve just had a
brilliant idea. Why don’t you divorce Mr. Compton and
marry Mowbray?”</p>

<p>“Aw!” Ida dropped her cigarette and burned a hole
in her skirt. “Are you raving crazy?”</p>

<p>“I thought I was advancing a peculiarly level-headed
suggestion——”</p>

<p>“None of it in mine!”</p>

<p>“But, my dear Ida, you will tire inevitably of this old
camp. The glamour of all this return in a gilded chariot
drawn by the cheering populace will wear off in about six
months. So will your own novelty for them. It is all
indescribably cheap, anyhow. If you send Mowbray away
now, he will try to forget you, and forgetting is man’s
peculiar accomplishment. You will have missed a great
opportunity. You and Mr. Compton are manifestly indifferent
to each other. Seize your chance, dear—not only
for happiness, but for a splendid social position, before——”</p>

<p>Ora paused. Ida was glaring ahead of her with her
heavy black brows pushed low over her flaming eyes. Her
lips were drawn back over her sharp little teeth. Her
nostrils were distended. She looked like some magnificent
beast of the jungle stalking her prey.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_315">[315]</span>“By God!” she whispered, her whole body heaving,
“I’ll have him back. I was a fool before I left, and maybe
I shouldn’t have left him at all. It’s never safe to leave
a man. But when I do get him back he’ll be glad of all
I’ve learned. He’s like a lunatic with a fixed idea just
now—but wait.”</p>

<p>Ora felt cold and numb. She tried to rise, and wondered
if the shock had paralysed her. She managed to articulate:
“You love him then?”</p>

<p>But not even to Ora could Ida make any such admission;
she who always had flouted both sentiment and passion!
She recovered herself and tossed her head.</p>

<p>“Love! Who cares about love? Do you think I’m the
sort of woman a man can throw down for a mine? I
wouldn’t stand it even it were another woman—but ore!
It makes me sick. I won’t be thrown down. And I’ll get
him back!”</p>

<p>Ora too had recovered herself. She lit another cigarette.
“I’m so glad you don’t care, dear. No man is worth
agonising over, as you so often have said yourself. Forgive
the doubt. I should have remembered that you were
far too clever and worldly-wise for that sort of thing.
That is the main reason that I am willing to marry Valdobia:
I can be fond of him, like him always, be grateful
for his companionship, but he can’t tear my heart out.”</p>

<p>“I thought you told me when you came back that you
were mad about him?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I fancy I was strung up that day. When I am
excited I always exaggerate. But do think over what I
have said about Mowbray. And it would be heavenly to
have you in Europe.”</p>

<p>“My mind’s made up. I guess I’m American to my core
and marrow. Titles will never seem natural to me, and
I guess we’ll both live to see them so tangled up with
democracy that those that are left will look like old labels
on new cans. No has-beens in mine. Oh, chuck it! What’s
this I hear about little Whalen—that he’s resigned from
the High and been out in the mountains prospecting since
the beginning of Spring? I’ve only seen him once since I
came back and then he looked like a viper that had been
stepped on.”</p>

<p>“I met him the other day when I was out walking. He
bought a claim of one of the prospectors that swarmed out<span class="pagenum" id="Page_316">[316]</span>
there as soon as they heard of the Primo and the Perch
strikes. He wore overalls and a beard. I scarcely knew
him. He talked rather wildly about the hill he has located
on being another Perch of the Devil.”</p>

<p>“I guess Gregory is responsible for that and a good
many other wild dreams. I hear that a lot of young men
are coming out from the East this Summer to prospect in
those hills. Well, they’ll succeed or fail according to their
luck mostly. Let’s go out. You’ve got two hours before
your train goes—but if you’ve got a list a yard long——”</p>

<p>And the two sallied forth in perfect peace to shop.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">ORA had more than one cause for uneasiness when she
returned to her little home in the pine woods, but
paramount was the fear that she should not see Gregory
Compton again unless by accident. She rose early after
another almost sleepless night and spent a distracted day
wandering over the hills, returning at intervals to inquire
if her telephone bell had rung. Once more she felt a disposition
to run away, anathematising the slavery of love.
Only the hope that Mowbray would wear down Ida’s
resistance kept her from yielding to the impatient, imaginative,
too highly organised woman’s impulse to flee
when love seems hopeless and a nervous explosion imminent.
She still refused to feel traitorous to Ida, but she
did wonder once or twice if she ever should dare to face
her as Mrs. Gregory Compton. Ida was the reverse of a
fool. She might be blind now, for obvious reasons—but
Ora shrugged her shoulders at the vision of Ida’s horror
and wrath. What did she care for Ida or any other
woman if she got her man?</p>

<p>She made one of her sudden dashes into the house
as the telephone bell was ringing. For the moment she
thought she was about to faint; then, both appalled and
angry at the lawless behaviour of her nerves, she stamped
her foot, shook herself, marched over to the telephone, took
down the receiver, and asked in a bored voice: “Well?”</p>

<p>“I shall come to supper tonight if you will have me?”
Gregory’s tones were those he employed when “canning”
a miner.</p>

<p>“Delighted.” Ora’s nerves fell into place like good
little soldiers. “Will you be here at seven?”</p>

<p>“About. I prefer to have you tell me here what she had
to say.”</p>

<p>“Constitutionally opposed at present, but that was to
be expected. Seeds always sprout if well planted and
judiciously watered. Our friend from England will do
his part.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_318">[318]</span>“Good. We’ll say no more about it. But I shall go to
see you as usual.”</p>

<p>“Why not? We are not fools or children. Any new
developments at the mine?”</p>

<p>“Shaft has reached third level. Vein seems to be about
the same richness as on the second. Mann is here. Good-bye.”</p>

<p>As Ora, her body no longer braced and rigid, but so filled
with the languor of happiness that she wanted to throw
herself down on the divan and sleep, crossed the room,
she became aware that someone was standing in the outer
doorway. His hat was in his hand, and as she focussed her
absent gaze she managed to recognise Professor Whalen.
Her impulse was to turn her back and run into her bedroom;
but Ora was always a great lady. She could be
extremely rude to a member of her own class, but she had
never permitted herself to wound the morbid sensitiveness
of those to whom fortune had been less kind. So, secretly
wondering if the little man really stood there, or if anything
so insignificant mattered, she went forward smiling
and offered him her hand.</p>

<p>“So good of you to come and have a cup of tea with
me.” She rang a bell and ordered tea of her Chinaman.
“But why did you dress up? I am accustomed to overalls
and flannel shirts, and quite like the idea of living in a
mining camp.”</p>

<p>Whalen sat on the edge of his chair and stared into the
fire, twirling his hat in his hands. “I guess I’ve got to be
a gentleman again,” he said with a short laugh. “There’s
nothing else left for me to be.”</p>

<p>“Oh! I hope——”</p>

<p>“My find—and I paid a thousand dollars for the claim—was
nothing but a gash vein. Nothing in that but low
grade carbonates.”</p>

<p>“But are you so sure? Often veins appears to pinch out
a hundred feet or more above a really rich lode.”</p>

<p>“I’ve poured into that hole all my savings; all I had
saved from my salary during four years, and every cent
of my reward in the field of letters. I even—and against
my secret resolutions—consumed a legacy left me by an
uncle.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps if you would ask Mr. Compton to look at
your claim—he is a sort of ore wizard——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_319">[319]</span>“I’ll ask no favours of Gregory Compton!” Whalen
burst out, violently. “Were it not for him I never would
have been enticed into this foolish venture. I cannot
realise it—I, who was brought up in the most conservative
corner of this conservative country—I, a pedagogue, a man
of letters, that I should have so far descended as to become
a prospector—live in a hut, cook my own bacon,
dig with a pick——” He paused choking.</p>

<p>“Doubtless you remembered that some of the greatest
millionaires in the country began that way. Or possibly
the Northwest kindled your sense of adventure—that is
inherent in every real man. But why blame Mr. Compton?”</p>

<p>Whalen had recovered his breath. He spat out his
words. “Why should a man like that have all the luck?
And such colossal luck! Who is he? What is he? In
what way does he compare with me—a man of no family,
of no culture, of no intellect——”</p>

<p>“Mr. Compton has given evidence that he has one of the
best brains this country has produced.” Ora spoke evenly
but with a glint in her eye.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, <i>brains</i>! I make a fine distinction between mere
brains and intellect. He has the sort of mental composition
those men always seem to have in order that they may
make use of their luck and roll up millions. But intellect?
Not a cell. He has never read anything. I journeyed
with him from Pony to Butte not long since and
endeavoured to engage him in conversation. I might as
well have tried to talk to a mummy—and an ill-mannered
one at that. The moment I left the subject of mines he
merely looked out of the window.”</p>

<p>Ora laughed merrily, and poured out the tea the Chinaman
had brought in. “Perhaps it is just that lack of
overdevelopment that we call intellect which permits these
men to concentrate upon their genius for making money.”</p>

<p>“But that has nothing to do with their luck in the
beginning. Luck! Blind luck! Fool’s luck! And why
not to me? Why to this Gregory Compton? I never believed
in luck before, but since this rush, and my own personal
experience——” He swallowed a mouthful of tea
too hastily, scalded himself, and, while he was gasping, Ora
said soothingly:</p>

<p>“You cannot help believing in luck if you study the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_320">[320]</span>
early history of any mining state. There are hundreds
of stories of prospectors—you have told of many yourself;
the majority had little or no education, less science. Out
of a hundred evenly equipped with grit, common sense,
some practical knowledge of ores, perhaps two would find
a rich pocket or placer. Four or five possibly made a
strike that would insure them a competence if they neither
gambled nor drank. The rest nothing—not after forty
years of prospecting in these mountains. I fancy there
is something in that old phrase about the lucky star; in
astronomical parlance the position of the planets at the moment
of one’s birth.”</p>

<p>“But why not I?” wailed the professor. “Why—why
this—well, he is a friend of yours—Gregory Compton?”</p>

<p>“<i>Why not?</i>”</p>

<p>“I am infinitely his superior in every way!” cried
Whalen in perfect good faith. “It is I who should have discovered
those millions and taken them to Beacon Street,
not this obscure young Westerner, son of an illiterate old
ranchman——”</p>

<p>“But you didn’t,” said Ora, patiently. “Besides, the
fates are not unjust. They made you a member of the
New England aristocracy, and gave you intellect. Do not
be unreasonable and demand the mere prospector’s luck as
well.”</p>

<p>Whalen looked at her suspiciously, but her eyes were
teasing, not satiric. He had admired her always more than
any woman he had met in the West, and had come to her
blindly to be consoled. Suddenly he saw an indefinable
change steal over her face, although her mouth remained
curled with the stereotyped smile she kept for the Whalens.
It was as if something deep in her brilliant eyes
came to life, and her slight bust rose under the stiff shirtwaist.
Whalen’s ears were not acute and he did not hear
the light footstep that preceded a peremptory knock. Ora
crossed the room swiftly and opened the door. Whalen
was no fool, and he had written fiction for four years.
He had guessed at once that his beautiful hostess loved the
man who demanded admittance, and when he heard Gregory
Compton’s voice he almost whistled. But he merely
arose and frowned.</p>

<p>“Knocked off and thought I would run in early,” Gregory
was beginning, when he saw Whalen. “How are you?”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_321">[321]</span>
he asked with more cordiality than he usually wasted upon
the little man. His spirits always flew to his head when
he met Ora, stolid as he might look. “How’s your mine
getting on?” he added, as he selected the longest of the
chairs before the fire. “Heard it had petered out.”</p>

<p>“It has!”</p>

<p>“I’ll go over and have a look at it tomorrow if you like.
I fancy you’re located too close to one of the faults. The
trouble with you amateur prospectors—or buyers of prospectors’
claims—is that you don’t take a geologist out
with you. You lose your heads over an assay report
on exceptional specimens. But I’d like to see for myself.”</p>

<p>“It’s no use,” said Whalen gloomily. “I have used up
all my money in that——” He had learned to swear in
mining camp society, but he pulled himself up hastily,
“that hole.”</p>

<p>“If I think there is anything there I’ll grub-stake you.
Nobody would buy your claim, but somebody might jump
it if you let it lapse, and I want to know who my neighbours
are. Have you patented it?”</p>

<p>“Not yet.”</p>

<p>“Spent five hundred dollars on it?”</p>

<p>“<i>Have</i> I!”</p>

<p>“Well, I’ll look at it tomorrow, and if I think it’s good
for anything I’ll help you out. I am going to Helena in
a day or two. Come along and apply for your patent.”</p>

<p>“You are very kind.” Whalen felt repentant, and
more grateful than he had ever condescended to feel before.
“I’ll expect you tomorrow.” He inferred that he
could best show his gratitude by taking himself off, and
rose. “Good afternoon, Mrs. Blake. This hour has been
refreshing and inspiring after my long absence from
civilisation.”</p>

<p>“You must come soon again,” said Ora sweetly, as she
marshalled him out. “The best of luck.”</p>

<p>She went to her bedroom for a few moments, and when
she returned wore a soft tea gown made of several shades
of woodland greens. She seated herself in her favourite
chair, straight, with a high carved back, and took up her
neglected embroidery. “Dinner will not be ready for
half an hour,” she said. “How long that little man did
stay. I am glad you made a friend of him, for I have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_322">[322]</span>
always imagined that he could be venomous, and before
you came in he was by way of hating you. Now tell me
the surprise you have for the geologists and newspaper men
on the second level.”</p>

<p>And for the next three hours they talked of ores.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">“GIVE me your hand, Gregory. I am no coward, but
this is the first time I have ever been underground.
My father would never permit it, nor my mother after
him.”</p>

<p>Gregory extended his long arm behind him and Ida’s
warm firm fingers clung to his hand. They had just left
the skip at the second level of his mine. The geologists
and the newspaper men, together with herself, Lord John,
Gregory, and Mann, had entered the mine by way of the
Primo shaft, inspected the insignificant vein of copper
which had merely been blocked out, awaiting the possible
erection of a concentrating plant—for it was not worth the
expense of freight to Anaconda—thence down the ladder
from the hole blasted by Apex, and into the drift where
the magnificent vein of Perch of the Devil also merely had
been blocked out; but for a more subtle reason. The
case in Gregory’s favour was so flagrant that the great men
had laughed, although gracefully submitting to interviews
on the spot and expressing themselves with as few technicalities
as possible. That the Primo copper upon which
Apex had also sunk was a mere attenuated fork of the
great vein which indisputably had faulted from the original
vein in Gregory Compton’s property the reporters
could see for themselves. Under the Apex law Gregory
was within his lateral rights in sinking under the adjoining
claim and thence under the Primo mine; and as
far beyond as the vein persisted.</p>

<p>Against a man less determined and resourceful than
Gregory Compton a wealthy corporation could obtain any
verdict it demanded; but to persist in a suit for Apex rights
after this public exposition would make any trust the
laughing-stock of a continent. Even to persist in the claim
that he was mining under an agricultural patent, and
therefore outside his rights, would be mere petty persecution;
and inevitably both suits would steal noiselessly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_324">[324]</span>
to limbo. Amalgamated knew when it was beaten and
would take its medicine with a grimace and watch for its
next opportunity.</p>

<p>Ida, although she disliked the sensation of being underground,
the chill of the tunnels and the drip of candle-grease
on her smart linen skirt, had been deeply impressed
by the scene in the excavation on the Perch vein: the men
with their keen upturned faces, their peering eyes so
close to the moving candles, the little yellow flames travelling
along the beautiful yellow metal, the eager nervous
hands of the newspaper men, the intense blackness beyond
the radius of the candles. But her eyes returned constantly
to her husband’s face. His eyes gleamed with
copper fires. His profile against the dark background of
the cavern looked as if carved in the rock by some prehistoric
race.</p>

<p>The blood scorched her face and her heart leapt with
pride as she heard these distinguished men defer to him,
express their admiration without reserve. A year ago he
had been as little known as when she married him. Today
his extraordinary abilities were recognised by the entire
country, and tomorrow he would be one of its colossi.</p>

<p>She was the only woman that had gone down. Mrs.
Cameron and Mrs. Collier had preferred to remain comfortably
with Ora in the bungalow, or to help her spread
the tables under the pines, where luncheon was to be
served. Therefore was she privileged to keep close to
the host, and when they descended into the blackness of
the second level she embraced further her feminine prerogatives.
Mann had gone down first, the guests had followed,
and Gregory, after a vain protest, had taken her
down in the skip when it returned for himself.</p>

<p>The rest of the party had pushed forward, for they had
been promised a surprise. Ida would have lingered, but
Gregory pulled her on. He wanted to hear the comments.
The racket of the drills had stopped. Ida saw the
last of the guests disappear up a short ladder.</p>

<p>“Am I to go up into a stope?” she asked.</p>

<p>“If you want to see what we’ve come for.” He ran up
the ladder, and she followed, insinuated herself into the
hole and stood upright in the large excavation on the
vein.</p>

<p>“Is it gold?” she gasped.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_325">[325]</span>“No, but it’s a streak—a shoot—of chalcopyrite ten
feet wide and of the highest value. And it may go down
eight or nine hundred feet before it loses its richness and
degenerates into a lower grade of ore. But there may be
millions of tons of that. This is one of the few great
shoots of chalcopyrite known.”</p>

<p>“Gregory!” said Ida ecstatically, “do you remember
I always had such faith in you that I urged you so often
to prospect on the ranch that you got quite cross?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I remember.”</p>

<p>“Never say I doubted you. I may be enchanted at all
this success and recognition of your abilities, but I have
never had the least sensation of surprise.”</p>

<p>Gregory smiled down into the eager beautiful face so
close to his shoulder. She had manipulated him down the
ladder into the tunnel and for the moment they were alone.
“I hope you are half as proud of me as I am of you,” he
said gallantly, although he was a trifle uneasy; not because
she looked as if she might kiss him there in the semi-dark,
but because he felt an impulse to kiss her. For the moment
he regretted the wild romance upon which he was
embarked, the torments of its present, the tragic possibilities
of its future. Ida now would make an ideal wife, demanding
far less of his jealously guarded inner self, to
say nothing of his time, than Ora, who had that most
terrible of all gifts, a passionate soul. But this disloyalty
was brief, and he frowned and disengaged his hand, although
he was far from suspecting that Ida had yielded to
the temptation to pay him deliberate court.</p>

<p>“I shall be able to give you a string of pearls before
long,” he said lightly, “or a million or two to play with.
I want to hear what these men have to say. Suppose you
go back with Lord John, and tell them that we are coming
up soon for lunch. Ring the bell in the station twice for
the skip and three times for hoist.”</p>

<p>Ida shrank back against the wall as if she had been
struck, but when Lord John, who had made several futile
attempts to separate her from her husband, came eagerly
forward, she left Gregory to the chorus of enthusiasm and
congratulation, and obeyed his directions.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_326">[326]</span>

<h3 class="nobreak">XIX</h3>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">IDA was in such high spirits during the luncheon that
she managed to be brilliant and amusing within the
limits of her expurgated vocabulary. Only Ora, who knew
her so well, saw the sombre fire in the depths of her eyes,
the sudden twist of her mouth at the corners, noted that
her cheeks were crimson instead of their usual delicate
coral, the occasional clenching of her hands. But she had
little time to speculate upon the cause, for the large party
were her guests, and, like any other Rocky Mountain
hostess in the liquid month of June, she feared the sudden
drenching of her tables.</p>

<p>But the day remained fine, and the geologists, who ever
since their arrival in Butte had evinced a remarkable indifference
to geology as a topic for conversation, were as
lively as the newspaper men, and deeply appreciative of
the good looks and animated conversation of the four
women who ate almost nothing in their efforts at mental
subdivision. Ora had invited also her engineer and Professor
Whalen, placing the latter as far from Ida as possible;
but she saw that he was covertly watching the
woman he must hate. Ida had thrown him a careless nod
when they met by the tables in the grove; and he had returned
it with a bow of surpassing dignity.</p>

<p>Gregory, now that the men of science and of the press
had served his purpose, was eager to be rid of them, and
excused himself when the luncheon was half over, on the
plea that he was his own manager and needed at the mine.
He disappeared into the Primo shaft house, as he often
took that short cut to his own shaft, and Mowbray, who
had been silent, for Gregory affected his buoyant spirits
unaccountably, moved his chair up beside Ida and endeavoured
to divert her mind from the general to the
specific. But she snubbed him and he relapsed into gloom.
On the train, however, when she saw that Whalen, who
was on his way to Helena to apply for his patent, was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_327">[327]</span>
watching her, she flirted pointedly with the handsome
Englishman.</p>

<p>The guests were to leave Butte on the seven o’clock
train, which, fortunately for the strain that all were beginning
to feel, was only half an hour late. When it
had pulled out and Ida had waved her last farewell, she
walked in silence to her car, and intimated with a curt
nod that Mowbray might take the seat beside her. “But
tell Ben where you want to go,” she said, “for I can’t
ask you to dine with me tonight.”</p>

<p>Mowbray told the chauffeur to drop him at the Club
and then asked his lady, whose animation had dropped to
zero, if anything had happened to annoy her, or if she were
merely worn out.</p>

<p>“Don’t ask me any questions,” said Ida sharply. “I’m
sorry to seem inhospitable but I’ve got something to think
out. You can go to the dance at the Country Club.”</p>

<p>“I shall more likely go to my rooms and write letters.
Don’t worry about me. Shall we have a ride tomorrow
morning?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know.”</p>

<p>Mowbray was always philosophical about women, having
been brought up with many sisters. “You are tired out,”
he said without too much sympathy. “Just call me up
if you feel like doing anything in the morning.”</p>

<p>“All right. Good night.”</p>

<p>She left him at the Silver Bow Club. Her own house
was only a few blocks distant. She told the maid who
admitted her that she wanted no dinner and should go
to bed at once and without assistance. When she reached
the seclusion of her bedroom she locked the door, flung
her hat on the floor and stamped on it, broke several valuable
objects, and then paced up and down, gritting her
teeth to keep from screaming.</p>

<p>There was but one person on earth that she hated more
than she hated Gregory Compton and that was herself.
She had meant to play a waiting game of many interviews,
in which her fine calculation had mapped out the
insidious approach, the adroit pushing aside of barrier
after barrier, until Gregory returned almost inadvertently
to his allegiance. She had no desire for romantic scenes;
they would have embarrassed herself, and with her instinctive
knowledge of man, she knew that Gregory would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_328">[328]</span>
shrink back from any situation that might involve explanations.
Nor did she wish to let a man so absorbed
as Gregory feel that he was loved too much, lest he chafe
at the thought of feminine exactions, and his mind continue
to dwell upon the delights of freedom. He might be
capable of moments when the woman alone existed, but
there would be long intervals when he would hate a
woman’s clinging arms if they made him ten minutes late
for his work, particularly if he was headed for his beloved
mine. Ida, shrewd, self-controlled, watchful, knew herself,
now that her powers were developed, to be the natural
mate for such a man. He would drive a temperamental
woman mad.</p>

<p>And she had seemed to make a steady progress. The
geologists had remained for three days in Butte before
visiting Perch of the Devil. On the second evening they
had been entertained by the professors of the School of
Mines, but on the other two evenings she had given them
elaborate dinners, and Gregory had attended each. She
had seen that he was increasingly proud of her, and grateful.
Upon both occasions they not only had had a little
talk apart but he had drifted back to her more than once.</p>

<p>And today she had spoiled everything! In the darkness
of that mine she had weakened and made open love to
him. She had practically offered herself—she ground her
teeth as she thought of her clinging fingers, her appealing
eyes, her cheek almost brushing his—and he had rejected
her—with consideration, but finality!</p>

<p>If he had knocked her down she would have cherished
hope. But in this hour she had none. His indifference
was colossal. The busiest men in America had their
women; she no longer could comfort herself with the delusion
that the mine was a controlling and exclusive passion;
she merely had ceased completely to attract him—and
she remembered how thorough he was; she no more
could relight those old fires than she could blow life into
the dead ashes of Big Butte. He would turn to another
woman one of these days; it was not within human possibility
that he would go through life without love; but
not to her! not to her! She would do to entertain his
friends, to flaunt his wealth and advertise his success; in
time no doubt he would treat her as a confidential friend;
but sexually she was an old story. It was apparent that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_329">[329]</span>
the mere thought bored him; it was only when Gregory
was bored that he was really polite.</p>

<p>If she could but have accepted this, resigned all hope,
instead of subjecting herself to humiliation; she, who
had never failed to send the blood to a man’s head with
a glance! She didn’t want to hate him. She didn’t want
to hate herself. Why could she not have been content to
accept the inevitable with philosophy and grace?</p>

<p>The answer that, owing to some mysterious law of her
being, she loved him, made her want to smash everything
else in the room; but she would have some difficulty concealing
the present wreckage from her servants, so she bit
her handkerchief to shreds instead.</p>

<p>When the furies had tired her body she fell into a chair
and although her brain was still hot with the blood sent
there by excitement and lack of food, she admitted frankly
that the peculiar nature of her agitation was due to
wounded pride and intense mortification; had she arrived
at a point where she no longer could hope, but without
self-betrayal, she might have wept bitter tears, but there
still would have been a secret sweetness in loving him.
Now, she growled out her hatred. She longed to do something
to hurt him. If she only were another sort of
woman! She would go to Mowbray’s rooms, go to Helena
with him for a week. And simultaneously she yearned to
be consoled, not only in her heart but in her wounded
pride.</p>

<p>Should she ask her husband for a divorce; revenge
herself by becoming an English duchess? Ora, in the
moment or two they had found together at the station,
had told her that Mowbray’s older brother was at Davos,
unmistakably dying of tuberculosis, and that his engagement,
insisted upon by his father, had been broken. Valdobia
had given her this news in his last letter, adding
the hope that his friend would bring Ida back with him
that they might all be together once more.</p>

<p>Was this the solution of her problem? A marriage that
would demonstrate to Gregory Compton that her moment
of seeming weakness was mere coquetry; a marriage that
would raise her an immeasurable social distance above
him; a permanent dissociation from everything that could
remind her of him and this terrible obsession that had disorganised
her being, reduced her to the grovelling level<span class="pagenum" id="Page_330">[330]</span>
of the women whose dependence on the favour of man she
had always despised?</p>

<p>When she reflected that her revenge would fall flat,
Gregory’s not being the order of mind to appreciate the
social pre-eminence of a titled race, she ground her teeth,
again. There was nothing left but to consider herself.
Should she choose the part that not only would exalt her
station and fill her life with the multifarious interests
of a British peeress, but banish this man in time from her
memory; or stay on and alternate torments with moments
of indescribable sweetness when he smiled upon her? And
might she not yet manipulate him into her net if she
continued to play the waiting game? Or would she go
wholly to pieces the first time they were alone together?</p>

<p>Her pride strangled at this possibility and brought her
to her feet. The blood was still boiling in her head, she
knew what nerves were for the first time in her life. She
made up her mind to go out and walk. In this part of
the town she was not likely to meet anyone.</p>

<p>She found another hat, put on a warm coat, and let
herself out of the house. It was ten o’clock. All the
West Side, no doubt, was at the Country Club.</p>

<p>For a time she walked rapidly and aimlessly, trying
to focus her mind on other things. But when a woman is
in love and the path is stony, she is obsessed much as
people are that suffer from shock and reiterate ceaselessly
the circumstances of its cause. Her brain seethed with
hate, longed for revenge. Nothing would have gratified
her more than to take the secret revenge of infidelity.
Many a woman has taken a lover for the satisfaction of
laughing to herself at her husband’s dishonour; to dishonour
being the most satisfactory of all vengeance,
whether open or concealed.</p>

<p>She realised abruptly that her thoughts had led her unconsciously
to the door of John Mowbray’s lodgings. The
flat had been lent him by a banker to whom he had brought
a letter from his brother, and who had gone East immediately
after his arrival; the banker’s wife lived in Southern
California. It occupied the second story of a house in
West Broadway and had its own entrance on a side street.
Mowbray had given a tea there a day or two before, and
Ida had presided.</p>

<p>She did not delude herself for a moment that she could<span class="pagenum" id="Page_331">[331]</span>
take her full revenge upon the unconscious Gregory, but
at least she could do something quite shocking, something
that would infuriate a husband. Ida was not afraid of
any man, least of all one that wished to make a duchess
of her, but it would be an additional satisfaction to torment
him, and an adventure with a spice of danger in it no
doubt would restore her equilibrium. If Mowbray made
violent love to her she felt, by some obscure process of
feminine logic, that she would forgive Gregory Compton.</p>

<p>She glanced hastily up and down the street, then more
sharply, wondering if she had dreamed that once or twice
she had looked over her shoulder with the sense of being
followed. It was a bright moonlight night. No one was
in sight. She rang the bell of Mowbray’s flat. The door
was opened from above. At the head of the stairs stood the
Jap who served as housekeeper and valet.</p>

<p>She hesitated a moment, taken aback. She had forgotten
the servant. Then she closed the door behind her.
“Is Lord John in?” she asked negligently.</p>

<p>The Jap spread out his hands deprecatingly. “His
lordship not at home,” he announced.</p>

<p>Ida hesitated another moment, then ascended the stair
and entered the living-room. “Turn on the lights,” she
said, “I shall wait for him.”</p>

<p>The Jap obeyed orders, bowed, and withdrew. For a
moment Ida was tempted to telephone to the Silver Bow
Club, but Mowbray was sure to return soon to write his
letters, and she liked the idea of giving him a surprise.
She lit a cigarette, selected a novel from the bookcase, and
sank into the most comfortable of the chairs. The room
was warm; both body and brain were very weary. The
cool night air had driven the blood from her head. She
yawned, dropped the book, fell sound asleep.</p>

<p>She awoke as the clock was striking half-past one. She
was still alone. For a moment she stared about her, bewildered,
then rose and laughed aloud.</p>

<p>“This is about the flattest——” She went swiftly out
into the hall and awoke the slumbering Jap. “You little
yellow devil,” she cried, “why didn’t you tell me that his
lordship had gone to the party at the Country Club?”</p>

<p>Once more the Jap was deprecating. “Madam did not
ask.”</p>

<p>Ida produced a gold piece. “Well, you are not to tell<span class="pagenum" id="Page_332">[332]</span>
him that I came, nor anyone else. If you do I’ll wring
your neck.”</p>

<p>The Jap’s eyes, fixed upon the gold, glistened. “Why
should I tell?” he asked philosophically; and having
pocketed the coin ran downstairs and bowed the lady out.</p>

<p>When Ida was about to turn the corner she whirled
about, this time with a definite sensation of being followed.
But the street was empty save for a man slouching down
the hill with an unsteady gait, his head nodding toward
his chest. It was a familiar sight in any mining town;
nevertheless she quickened her steps, and in a moment
was safe within her own house.</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap">ON the morning following the departure of the geologists
Gregory took the bit between his teeth and went in
to Butte to see his wife. In his first moment of shock
and confusion it had seemed to him best that Ora, whose
subtlety he recognised, was the one to manipulate Ida’s
still too formalistic mind toward the divorce court; but he
was unaccustomed to relegate any part of his affairs to
others, least of all to a woman. Nor did he think it necessary
to inform Ora of his sudden decision. He might
work almost double shift to keep her out of his thoughts
and diminish temptation, and he might marry her and continue
to love her passionately; but she would obtain little
ascendency over him. He knew what he wanted; he had
trained his will until at times it appeared formidable
even to himself, and he was as nearly the complete male
that regards woman, however wonderful, as the supplementary
female as still survives.</p>

<p>He had few illusions about himself, and it had crossed
his mind more than once, since the hope of divorce had
dazzled both of them, that for a year or two or least there
must be a certain amount of friction between a nature like
his and a complex, super-civilised, overgrown feminine
ego like Ora Blake. While he had sat with his legs
stretched out to the fire and his eyes half closed, his body
weary, but mentally alert, he had received certain definite
impressions of an independent almost anarchical mind,
contemptuous of the world and its midges save as they
might be of use to herself; of a mind too well-bred ever
to be managing and exacting in any vulgar sense, but inexorable
in its desires and as unscrupulous in their pursuit
as her father had been; of a superlative refinement coupled
with a power of intense and reckless passion found only
in women possessing that quality of imagination that
exalts and idealises the common mortal attributes. Moreover,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_334">[334]</span>
it was a mind that, the first joy of submission and
surrender diminished, would think for itself.</p>

<p>Until that night when both had dropped the mask for
a moment he had never thought of her as a complicated
ego, merely as one from whom he felt temporarily separated
after a union of centuries; and it had been the reluctant
admission that he knew her very little, save as a
gracious woman and his own companion, that had enabled
him to school himself to spend long hours with her alone as
before. He had tumbled blindly into matrimony once,
and no matter how much he might love this woman, to
whom he had seemed from the first to be united by a secret
and ancient bond, he was determined none the less to
marry the second time with his eyes wide open.</p>

<p>But although his glimpses of Ora’s winding depths gave
him moments of uneasiness he always fell back upon the
complacent reflection that he was a man, a man, moreover,
with a cast-iron will, and that the woman did not live who
would not have to adapt herself to him did he take her to
wife.</p>

<p>Until the day before the party at the mines he had been
content to drift, but a certain moment down in his own
mine had given a new and abrupt turn to both thoughts
and purpose. Ida might have spared herself her agonies
of shame: she had not betrayed her love, but she had given
him a distinct impression that she was employing her redoubtable
feminine weapons to reduce him to his old allegiance.
He had remembered for a poignant moment that
he once had loved this woman to distraction, and during
that moment he saw her again as the most beautiful and
distracting of her sex. His brief surrender had filled him
with fury. He had no intention of despising himself.
From boyhood up he had had nothing but contempt for
the man that did not know his own mind. If it had not
been for this serene confidence in himself, he, who was
constitutionally wary in spite of the secret and wistful
springs of romance in his nature and the apparent suddenness
of his bold plunges, never would have married Ida
Hook, nor any woman, until he had sounded her thoroughly.
But he had behaved like any hot-headed and conceited
young fool, and, much as he now admired Ida, it both
infuriated him and appalled him to feel even for a moment
toward her as he had in his raw inexperienced youth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_335">[335]</span>He therefore made up his mind to go to her like a
rational being and ask her to give him his freedom. They
had made a mistake. They were reasonable members of
an advanced civilisation, where mistakes were recognised
and rectified whenever possible. He did not doubt for a
moment that reason and logic must appeal as forcibly to a
woman as to himself.</p>

<p>The door of his wife’s house was opened after the usual
delay, and the maid told him that Mrs. Compton was upstairs
in the billiard room “or somewheres.” He took the
stairs three steps at a time lest his courage evaporate;
but drew a long breath of relief when he entered the large
square hall and saw nothing of Ida. He would have rung
for the maid, but reflected that no doubt he had already
provided enough gossip for the republic below stairs without
admitting that he did not know his way round his
wife’s house. He was about to knock on each door in turn
when he noticed that one in a corner at the end of the
hall was open and that it led into a narrow passageway.
Beyond there was light, possibly in one of those boudoirs
of which he had heard. Mrs. Murphy would have been sure
to have a boudoir, and no doubt Ida, little disposed as she
was to indolence, spent some part of her mornings in it.</p>

<p>He adventured down the passageway that terminated in
a large room full of sunlight. He saw his wife standing in
the middle of this room looking about her with a curious
expression of wistfulness. The little hall was carpeted, but
she heard him almost as soon as he saw her; she would
have known those light swift footsteps in a marching army.
He was inside the room before she could reach the doorway
and close it behind her and astonished to see a deep blush
suffuse her face. His quick darting glance took in his surroundings
as he shook hands with her. The room was a
nursery.</p>

<p>“I had two beds put in here and have just seen that
they were taken out,” stammered Ida.</p>

<p>Her embarrassment was communicable, but he said gruffly
as he walked to the window, “Didn’t know the Murphys
had children.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, they had two little ones. Seven in all. I
think it odd they should have left the toys here even if
they are rich enough to buy toys every day. There is
something sacred about a child’s toys.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_336">[336]</span>Ida was merely talking against time, but she hardly
could have said anything better calculated to arrest his
attention.</p>

<p>He turned and looked at her in astonishment.</p>

<p>“Do you mean to intimate—that you wish you had
children? You?”</p>

<p>Ida’s brain as well as her body was very weary, but
it sprang to action at once. “Oh, yes,” she said intensely.
“Oh, yes! And I might have had two! They would be
wonderful in this house.”</p>

<p>“But——” He cast about desperately. “With two
children you could not have gone to Europe.”</p>

<p>“That wouldn’t have mattered.”</p>

<p>“But—don’t you realise that it is this last year of unusual
advantages that has developed you so—so—remarkably?
You hated children——”</p>

<p>“And do you suppose it was Europe that made me want
children?”</p>

<p>“Oh, of course, nothing is as simple as that. You
were taken out of yourself, out of your narrow self-sufficient
little life; all your fine latent powers were developed——”</p>

<p>“But not altogether by Europe! Still, I don’t deny that
it woke me up, gave me not one new point of view but
many, developed me, if you like that better. Would you
like lunch earlier? You get up at such unearthly
hours——”</p>

<p>“I’m not hungry. I want to talk to you. That is what
I came for. Won’t you sit down—no, not here! Let us
go where there are comfortable chairs. I—I am tired.”</p>

<p>“Very well. Let us go down to the library.” As she
walked before him he noted that her superb body, which
usually looked as if set with fine steel springs, was heavy
and listless.</p>

<p>The masculine looking room below restored his balance.</p>

<p>“You don’t look as well as usual,” he remarked, as he
threw himself into the deepest of the chairs. “Yesterday
was a hard day, and you had had those men on your
hands for——”</p>

<p>“I am tired,” said Ida briefly, “but it doesn’t matter.
What do you want to talk to me about?”</p>

<p>He did not answer for a few moments, then he stood
up and thrust his hands into his pockets and scowled at the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_337">[337]</span>
carpet. Involuntarily Ida also rose to her feet and braced
herself, crossing her arms over her breast.</p>

<p>“It is impossible for this to go on,” said Gregory rapidly.
“It is unnatural. People don’t submit to broken
lives in these days. I think you had better get a divorce
and be happy. Mowbray seems to be a fine fellow. Of
course no one doubts that he has followed you here. He
could make you happy, and as soon as I am able—in a
year or two—I shall give you a million; in time more.”</p>

<p>“Oh! Oh!”</p>

<p>“You surely cannot want to live for ever like—like—this!”</p>

<p>“I have no desire to marry again. Have you?” She
shot the question at him, every nerve on edge with suspicion.</p>

<p>But the last thing in his mind was to betray Ora, and
he answered promptly. “No. But I am absorbed in my
mine, and my life will be more crowded every year with
accumulating interests. You are a woman. You are young—and—and—you
wish for children.”</p>

<p>Ida believed that after her revelation of yesterday he
had come to let her down gently. She determined to
throw her all on one heavy stake. If she lost, at least she
would have had the satisfaction of telling him that she
loved him; she had already sacrificed her pride, and there
was a reckless sweetness in the thought of revealing herself
absolutely to this man. When a woman loves a man not
quite hopelessly she experiences almost as much satisfaction
in listening to her own confession as to his.</p>

<p>She drew herself up, her arms still across her breast,
and Gregory thought he had never seen a woman look so
dignified and so noble.</p>

<p>“Listen, Gregory,” she said, with no tremor in her
voice but deepening sadness in her eyes, “I regret that I
have no children because they would be yours. I am willing
to live and die alone because I have lost your love.
I know how I lost it, but, as I look back over my crudity
and ignorance, I do not see how I could have kept it. You
were immeasurably above and beyond me. Nature, or some
mental inheritance, gave you sensitiveness, refinement, distinction,
to say nothing of brains. I had to achieve all
that I am now. I was a raw conceited fool like thousands
of American girls of any class, who think they are just a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_338">[338]</span>
little too good for this world. I had ceased to love you
in my inordinate love of myself, and the natural consequence
was, that as I made no attempt to improve myself,
I lost you as soon as my halo of novelty had disappeared.
I took for granted, however, that I was returning from
Europe to the old conditions. When I discovered that you
had no such intention I was piqued, astonished, angry.
But when I thought it all out I understood. You were
within your rights, and you have behaved with decency
and self-respect. I have nothing but unmitigated contempt
for two people that continue to live together as a mere
matter of habit and convenience. They are the real immoralists
of the world, and the girls that ‘go wrong’ know
it and laugh at the reformers. Of course I never had
ceased to love you down deep, but it took just the course
of conduct you pursued to make me known to myself. I
realise that it is hopeless—too late. I never intended to
betray myself, but I did so in an unguarded moment yesterday.
Otherwise I never should have told you all this.
I have realised since then that I have lost you irrevocably,
but at least if I cannot be your wife I will be no man’s,
and I shall continue to bear your name—and see you
sometimes.”</p>

<p>Gregory, feeling as if he were being flayed, had dropped
upon the edge of a chair and buried his face in his hands.
When she finished he said hoarsely: “I never dreamed—I
never imagined—I thought you incapable of real feeling——”</p>

<p>“I think I was then. And since—Well, you are only
a man, after all, and I made you think what I chose until
yesterday—Do you mean——” she added sharply, “that
you did not guess—did not <i>know</i> yesterday?”</p>

<p>“It never occurred to me. I thought you merely were
flirting a little——”</p>

<p>“Hi!” cried Ida. Then she got back into her rôle. “It
doesn’t matter,” she said with sad triumph. “I am glad
I have told you. As for the future? You have convinced
Butte that we are the best of friends. Stay away if you
wish unless I give an entertainment where your absence
would cause too much comment. You don’t want to
marry again, but you may feel yourself as free as air. And
one day—when you are worn out, tired of the everlasting
struggle in which you moneymakers work harder than<span class="pagenum" id="Page_339">[339]</span>
the day labourer, with his eight-hour laws and freedom from
the terrific responsibilities of money; when you begin to
break and want a home, I will make one for you. There is
the doorbell. Lord John is coming for lunch. I shall
give him his dismissal—once for all.”</p>

<p>Gregory stood up and took her hand. He had a vague
masculine sense of unfairness somewhere but he could not
begin to define it, and he was as deeply impressed as discouraged.
“You are a grand woman, Ida,” he said.
“This is not an hour that any man forgets. I wish that
you might be happy.”</p>

<p>“Nature never intended that people on this planet
should be happy—only in spots, anyhow. And don’t worry
about me. You have put me in the way of getting a great
deal out of this old game we call life, and I am grateful
to you. Good-bye.”</p>

<p>They shook hands and Gregory went out into the hall
as the maid was admitting Lord John. This time the men
made no pretence at politeness. They merely glared and
passed.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">THE Primo vein had been recovered some time since and
Ora had traversed the fault drift twice and watched
the drilling from the station; not only to assert her rights
as mistress of the mine but to experience the sensations
she had anticipated. She soon discovered that when a
woman is in love, and the issue doubtful, other interests
fail to provide sensations. But she went down into the
mine every day and roamed through the older workings.
She was tormented and restless, but by no means without
hope; and this being the case she sometimes wondered why
she continued to write to Valdobia as if nothing had occurred
to interfere with their tacit engagement. It was
her duty to tell him the truth, at once, but she switched
off all other currents every Saturday morning and wrote
her Roman long gay tantalising letters; being gifted as a
scribe, like so many women, she made them notable with
amusing and enlightening incidents of mining-camp life.</p>

<p>She had not seen Gregory since Monday evening. He
had gone suddenly to Butte on the morning following the
visit of the geologists, and had telephoned her that he
should take the afternoon train to the Capital and no doubt
be detained for several days. She had expected that he
would telephone or telegraph from Helena; that he would
write was too much to expect; she had never seen his handwriting.
But he had not recognised her existence.</p>

<p>Four days after his departure she went down into her
mine and walked as far as the ragged opening blasted
by the Apex men, thinking of Ida. How much longer
would it be before Mowbray overcame her prejudices, and
her own independent and proud spirit revolted under her
husband’s complete indifference? Few women were given
such an opportunity for revenge both subtle and open as
Mowbray was offering to Ida Compton.</p>

<p>It was at this point in her reflections that Ora heard a
light footfall coming down the fault drift of Perch of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_341">[341]</span>
Devil. Without an instant’s hesitation she descended the
short ladder that had been placed between the two drifts
for the benefit of the geologists, and relit her candle. She
met Gregory in the little station. He also held a candle,
but he was so startled at the apparition that he dropped
it. She thrust the point of her candlestick into a wooden
post.</p>

<p>“I was going over to see you,” he said unsteadily as
he picked up his candle, relighted it, and mechanically followed
her example. He turned abruptly and walked half
way up the drift and back, while she stood still, shivering
with anxiety. Something had put his determined serenity
out of joint. A crisis impended. She felt her unsteadiness
and sat down suddenly on the edge of an ore car,
fancying this dimly lighted room and the black passage
leading to it looked as a death-house cell must look on the
eve of execution.</p>

<p>Finally she stammered: “What is it? Please tell
me?”</p>

<p>He leaned against the wall in front of her. “I am afraid
it’s all up,” he said lifelessly. “I went in on Tuesday to
ask Ida to obtain a divorce. She refused to listen. She
has no wish to remarry and will have none of divorce.
Nothing could have been more definite than our interview.”</p>

<p>“But—but surely in time—if we have patience——”</p>

<p>“There is no hope. Mowbray entered as I left. She
intended to dismiss him at once.”</p>

<p>Ora, without reasoning, of which she was incapable
at the moment, felt that he had been convinced by more
than argument and mere words. She flung her arms over
her lap and dropping her head upon them burst into a
wild transport of tears and sobs; she was so unused to all
expression of emotion that she neither knew nor cared
how to control it, and the tears swept out the floodgates
that had held her passion in check.</p>

<p>She looked up suddenly and saw Gregory standing over
her with twitching face and clenched hands; and exulting
in the complete abandonment of all the controls that civilisation
has bred, she sprang to her feet, flung herself into
his arms and her own arms about his neck. She had her
immediate reward, for he nearly crushed her, and he kissed
her until they both were breathless and reeling.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_342">[342]</span>This was the passion she had read and dreamed of; for
once the realities were commensurate; instinct warned her
to postpone argument and prolong the moment to its
utmost. There was room in her brain for the doubt if such
a moment ever could come again, so little of love-making is
wholly unpremeditated. So she clung to him and kissed
him, and in that dim cavern his dark face, so reminiscent
of those great prehistoric races that interested him, looked
as he felt, primeval man that had found his mate.</p>

<p>But, whatever his ancient inheritance, he was the immediate
product of a highly practical civilisation. His keen
calculating brain sent a lightning flash across his passion.
He lifted her off her feet and sat her down on the ore
car. Then he took a candlestick in either hand.</p>

<p>“Come to the other station,” he said peremptorily, and
led the way to a less dangerous seclusion.</p>

<p>He was half way up the fault drift before Ora, subdued
but rebellious, stooped mechanically and found the
veil that she wore in place of a hat when in the mines. She
followed him slowly. She felt rather than reasoned that
she had missed her opportunity and wished angrily that
she had had lovers and knew better how to manage men.
By the time she reached the shaft station the confusion
in her mind had lifted somewhat and she had arrived
at the conclusion that she could not overcome him in the
same way again, but must use her brains. She sat down
on the box and smoothed her hair with apparent unconcern.</p>

<p>Gregory had disposed of the two candlesticks and said,
his voice still unsteady: “There isn’t much to say, but I
want to have my last interview with you in my mine. I
cannot get away from here for two or three days. Will
you leave at once?”</p>

<p>“Will you listen to me? I have my right to be heard?”</p>

<p>“What is there to say?”</p>

<p>She clasped her hands in her lap and looked up at him.
Gregory sighed and set his teeth. She looked surpassingly
lovely and rather helpless—women, at their best, always
seemed to him pathetic.</p>

<p>“Gregory,” she said, “you don’t doubt that I love
you?”</p>

<p>“No. But what is the use? Do you suppose I am going
to make you my mistress—all Montana would know it in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_343">[343]</span>
less than no time. I’m no saint, but it wouldn’t work—not
for us!”</p>

<p>“But you want me?”</p>

<p>“Oh!” He turned away, then swung round upon her.
She had stood up. Her head was bent forward. “You
should help me out!” he cried angrily. “Can’t you see—it’s
you I’m thinking of. Do you suppose I want all the
sporting women in Butte making horrible jokes about you—all
your friends cutting you? What’s a man good for
if he doesn’t protect a woman?”</p>

<p>“Love affairs have lasted for years without being found
out.”</p>

<p>“Precious seldom. And we are not buried in a big
city. I must live out here and you would either have to
live out here too, or I should be sneaking into your house
in Butte. A business-like intrigue! Remember I lived
somewhat before I married. Sentiment and romance soon
evaporate——”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, that is always what I have thought when I
have read the American novelists’ attempts to portray
what they call a ‘guilty love’. The only word that expresses
it delicately is <i>liaison</i>, and the setting should be
foreign as well. There is no background here. We are
still under the drab shadow of Puritanism. I have heard
it estimated that twenty-five thousand American women
go abroad every year to indulge in a fleeting <i>liaison</i> that
gives them courage to endure the desperately material and
commonplace life of this country for another year. You
don’t understand that because you never have been in
Europe. But Egypt—Italy—in Southern Europe anywhere—with
its unbridled beauties of nature and its far
more poetic beauties that centuries of art have given it—and
a thousand years of love behind us—Oh, cannot you
imagine how wonderful love would be? Do you think <i>I</i>
should ever want to come back?”</p>

<p>Gregory was staring at her. “Do you mean,” he stammered,
“that you would sacrifice your reputation openly—your
future—do you care enough for that?”</p>

<p>“I mean I love you so exclusively that I wish I had a
thousand times more to sacrifice.”</p>

<p>“But—but—there are always Americans travelling—and
you know many Europeans——”</p>

<p>“They are always easy to avoid. There are villas with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_344">[344]</span>
walls, and pink flowers on top of the walls. And we could
travel and see the wonders of art when the tourist season
was over. Nor would I monopolise you. You could have
the society of men of brains and achievement everywhere.”</p>

<p>He continued to stare at her radiant wistful face. He
had known that she loved him, but it had never occurred to
him that she would be willing to give up the world for his
sake. She was a proud woman, an aristocrat, she had an
exceptional position everywhere; the great world when
they parted stood ready to offer its consolations.</p>

<p>She had unrolled a heavenly vision! His mind had revolted
from debasing her to the status of what is euphemistically
known in the West as “sporting women”; he also
remembered the immediate disillusionments of his younger
manhood and wondered if the hideousness of Butte had
been responsible. The Mediterranean with its ancient civilisations
flourishing and forgotten before the historic period,
Egypt, full-grown offspring of a still more ancient
but vanished civilisation—both called to that archæological
instinct so closely allied to the geological, made him fancy
he heard faint ancestral voices. Ora’s eyes were holding
his, and her gaze was as powerful as his own. For the
moment he no longer was a son of the newest section of
the newest world. The turquoise waters of the Mediterranean
spread before him, but he saw it alive with galleys——</p>

<p>He jerked his eyes away, folded his arms and stared
downward. He must think rationally, not with vapours
in his brain. It might be that he would be more than
fool to sacrifice to any consideration the one chance for
happiness in perfect union that life would offer him.</p>

<p>Suddenly he became aware that he was staring at the
rocky floor of his mine, of its first level; the flickering candle
flames revealed bits of bright yellow metal. And below
was the second level with its superb shoot of copper ore
ten feet wide. And below, on the third level, still was the
vein far more beautiful than virgin gold. And down—down—in
those vast unlocked caverns—what mysteries—what
wonder-ores might not the earth harbour for him
alone to find and name——</p>

<p>“What are you thinking of?” cried Ora sharply. Then
she threw out her arms wildly. “I know! I know! It
is those accursed ores! Oh, God! What have I in me,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_345">[345]</span>
I, a mere woman, to compensate for the loss of a mine? I
was a fool—Of course! Of course!”</p>

<p>But Gregory, although his blood had frozen in his veins
at the horrid vision of a permanent divorce from his mine,
would make no such admission.</p>

<p>“Ora,” he said quietly, “it would be very wonderful—for
about three months. You would despise me if I were
content to dawdle away my life in an olive grove, or throw
away my best years and these great energies nature has
given me, doing nothing in that old civilisation in which I
could find no place. And in time you would resent the
weakness that had stranded you with no recourse in life but
myself. That sort of thing has never been a success and
never will be, because nature did not make man to live on
love alone, and it is much the same with the intellectual
woman. It wouldn’t work. Not with us. I have known
from the beginning that it must be marriage or nothing.
And Ida would not divorce me if I ran away with you.
She would be entitled to her revenge and she would take
it.” He leaned forward and signalled the station call.
“Please take the skip when it comes. I am going below.”
And he ran down the ladder.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">XXII</h3>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">ORA got into the skip and was whisked to the surface.</p>

<p>She drew the veil over her head and face, wishing
dimly that she had gone home through the mines; but a
moment later the veil fell to her shoulders unnoticed. As
she crossed the Apex claim she was vaguely aware that
someone, almost in her path, lifted his hat. She bowed
automatically, feeling like those poor wound-up royalties
who must smile graciously upon their loyal people even
though a cancer devour the body or the brain reel with
sorrow.</p>

<p>Whalen, abnormal in vanity and conceit though he was,
took no offence; not only was this in his estimation the one
great lady of the Western annex, but he was startled by
the expression in her fixed eyes of anguish, terror, and surprise.
He had seen Gregory Compton go down into his
mine not a half an hour ago, and it was easy for his fictionised
if unimaginative mind to conjure up a hazy picture
of the scene underground. He turned very red, partly
from gratification at being so close to human passion and
pain, but more from the knowledge that he shortly could
offer all the elements for another and a still more dramatic
crisis. At the same time he could do the one woman he
admired in this wilderness a good turn and heal his cankerous
ache for vengeance.</p>

<p>Ora went on to her little house and sank into a chair
before the burnt-out logs. Her body felt as if it were a
vessel into which had been poured all the waters of woman’s
bitterness and despair. Nevertheless, her predominant
sensation was astonishment. For a year she had lived
in a fool’s paradise, indissolubly mated with Gregory
Compton. It was only in the moment when the idea of
his own divorce flashed into her mind that she realised she
had meant to have him for ever, that her imagination had
been a mere playground on which she had romped, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_347">[347]</span>
abruptly abandoned when she saw reality standing at the
gate.</p>

<p>Since that day, interrupted only by the fevers and doubts
of love, she had accepted with joy her predestined fate as
the visible mate of Gregory Compton. Else what did it all
mean? She had counted on marriage, but that respectable
solution had faded into utter insignificance as soon as the
shock of Ida’s refusal had passed. To fling the world aside,
to regard it as a mere whirling speck in the void, followed
as a matter of course. She and this man would fill all
space.</p>

<p>And she had lost. It was over. <i>Over. Over.</i> For a
time the astonishment consequent upon the mental reiteration
of this fact held her. Her mind, quick, alert, sinuous
as she had always found it, was unable to readjust itself.
How could anything be over that manifestly had been
created to go on for ever? What, then, did it all mean:
that mutual recognition when they had sat together that
night in Butte, that long mental obsession, this later perfect
understanding, this indubitable power to find in each
other complete happiness? Over. And by the man’s decree.
How odd. How odd. And what a tragic waste.</p>

<p>She knew that the mine had pulled him, but she was
too much the woman to take a mine seriously. There had
been some other reason. He loved her; she never doubted
that. He had resisted—why? She groped back through
her limited experience, wondering if the trouble were that
she had had so little. Life had not begun with her until a
year ago. She had been a mere student, deliberately living
in the unreal, often deluding, world of books, the worst
of all preparations for life.</p>

<p>Some women were independent of experience, knew men
by instinct. She felt that Ida, in a similar situation, would
have had her way. She had not managed cleverly; no
doubt with all her charm and her natural allurement for
men, even a certain acquired coquetry, she was one of
those women that could theorise brilliantly, but failed
utterly to manage their own affairs at critical moments.</p>

<p>She was well aware that she had not been developing
along ideal lines of late, particularly since she had come
out here with the unadmitted intention of stealing her
friend’s husband. By all the laws of tradition she should
be wicked all through. Pride, diffidence, fastidiousness—one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_348">[348]</span>
or all, she was in no condition to decide—had prevented
her from playing the deliberate rôle of siren. She
sighed and wished that life could be played upon the
formula adopted by so many brilliant novelists: a steady
unrelenting development of character upon strictly logical
lines and by means of cunningly created situations, that
was as much like life as a mother’s formula would be for
the thoughts and deeds of her children at a given hour a
year hence.</p>

<p>Ora did not know that most people in their rare moments
of honest introspection find themselves singularly
imperfect. She had looked for greater consistency in her
complex recesses; assuming that if she made up her mind
to take the husband of any woman, and that woman her
best friend, she would be wholly hard and wicked, and,
for the sake of the result, quite willing to achieve this consistent
imperfection. And such hardness would be the
surest of all solaces in the event of failure. She felt neither
hard nor nearly as wicked as she should, but she did recognise
the fact that if she had one more chance she would win
by hook or crook.</p>

<p>Her thoughts swung to Ida. What had she said to
Gregory in that last decisive interview? Ida was as clever
as the devil. She would watch her chance and make just
the right appeal at the right moment. Gregory could be
ruthless to the woman of whom he had wearied or to the
woman he loved, but if his wife played upon his honour,
his Western chivalry, his sense of fair play, and reiterated
her own rights—to her would he lower his flag if it struck
the life out of his own heart, and left himself nothing to
feed the deep passion and romance of his nature for the
rest of his life.</p>

<p>In any case Ida had won.</p>

<p>Once more Ora wished that she had gone to work when
she found herself penniless after her father’s death. She
would have developed normally, and it was unthinkable
that in the little world of Butte she would not have met
Gregory Compton while he was free. Then not only would
she be happy today but know nothing of those abysmal
depths in her soul which she execrated while yielding to
them and lamenting that for the time being they were no
worse. Love may be divine when all goes well, or one is
born into the cult of the martyr, but when it comes too<span class="pagenum" id="Page_349">[349]</span>
late to passionate natures associated with virile and accomplished
minds, it can be the very spawn of hell. Ora’s
regret that she was not of the breed of those finished wantons
of history that rose to fame on the shattered hearts
of men was born of expediency. Could she have been
given her choice and Gregory Compton she would have
elected to be fine and noble, consummating the lofty dictates
of her superior intellectual endowment. Not yet had
she realised that lacking a ruthless centralised ideal, rarely
allied to brilliant intellects, the souls of women even more
than those of men (who have less time and more poise) are
the playthings of Circumstance.</p>

<p>She became aware that her Chinaman was crossing the
room, and before she could refocus her wandering mental
vision and intercept him, he had opened the front door and
admitted Professor Whalen.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">XXIII</h3>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">IDA had broken a dinner engagement and sat alone in her
library. She knew that Gregory had passed through
Butte that day on his way from Helena to Pony; she had
seen him leave the Block where his lawyers had their offices
and jump into a waiting taxi. He was not the man to take
a cab for anything but an imminent train. She had
rushed home, but he had neither called nor telephoned.
She reasoned that he would be more than man if he were
not reluctant to see her again after their last embarrassing
interview, that there was no cause for fresh doubts, and
that there was literally nothing for her to do at present
but continue to play her waiting game. But she felt both
sad and nervous, and wondered if it were in her to despair,
to “cut and run” like other women; or whether it might
not be wise to absent herself for a time. Gregory was the
sort of man to appreciate delicacy, and after an absence of
two months they would meet quite naturally. She could
visit Yellowstone and Glacier Park, and send him pleasant
impersonal postcards.</p>

<p>But although she hesitated to acknowledge it, she was
tired of her waiting game, she wished that “fate would get
a move on”, and she had left her husband once with unforeseen
results. She leaned her elbows on her knees and
pressed her hands against her face. She had always
cherished a high opinion of her cleverness in regard to
men, but she was nonplussed. For a woman of her resource
there should be some alternative to waiting. She
knew that she had made a deep impression on her husband
in that momentous interview, but who could say that he
had not deliberately put the memory of it out of his
mind? Certainly there was no sign that it had softened him
or paved the way for her reinstatement into his life.</p>

<p>She was alarmed at her waning self-control. During
these last few days she barely had been able to play her
part in society; the people at the various functions she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_351">[351]</span>
had attended had seemed to her confused and absent mind
like marionettes that she could sweep off the stage with her
arm, and she had retreated into her shell lest she insult
them irreparably.</p>

<p>She brought her heavy brows together. Could there be
another woman after all? Gregory was cleverer than any
detective. Why should it occur to him to suggest divorce,
he a man so absorbed in a mine that he had forgotten
how to live—merely out of consideration for a discarded
wife whose existence he generally managed to forget?
It was certainly odd, and its idiosyncrasies grew and
swelled as she brooded. She wondered if she had been a
fool. But who in heaven’s name could the woman be?
Of course it was only a passing fancy, but could she
wait, <i>could she wait</i>?</p>

<p>She was aroused by a slight cough, discreet but full of
subtle insolence. She sprang to her feet, and Whalen
smiled as he saw her drawn face and bloodshot eyes. He
stood just within the door, and held a cap in his hand.
He wore a light automobile coat; a pair of goggles only
half covered his bulging brow. His upper teeth were
clamped down over his lower lip, a habit when steadying
his nerves. Ida thought she had never seen him look so
hideous, so like a mongrel cur.</p>

<p>“What do you want?” she asked.</p>

<p>“How gracious you are! How like Mrs. Blake, who
would not forget her manners if she——”</p>

<p>“I’ve got no manners for your sort. Get out.”</p>

<p>“Oh, not yet. I’ve something to say. I’ve waited for
over a year, but my time has come——”</p>

<p>“You’ll go out the way you went last time if you don’t
say what you’ve got to say pretty quick and get out by
yourself.”</p>

<p>Whalen looked over his shoulder nervously, and measured
the distance to the front door. He had asked leave
of the maid to announce himself, and, when she had disappeared,
reopened the door and left it ajar.</p>

<p>“It won’t take me long,” he said grimly. “It took me
a little longer to tell Mrs. Blake, for she was hard to convince;
but she <i>was</i> convinced before I left. It is merely
this: I saw you go into Lord John Mowbray’s rooms on
Monday night shortly after ten o’clock and come out at
half-past one.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_352">[352]</span>“Oh, you did, did you? I had a feeling all the time
there was a sneak in the neighbourhood. Well, much good
your spying will do you. Lord John was at the Country
Club until three in the morning and everybody knows it.”</p>

<p>She spoke calmly, but she was profoundly disturbed.
She continued, however, in the same tones of cutting contempt,
for she saw that he was taken aback, “I merely misunderstood
an invitation of Lord John’s for a bridge
party. I thought it was for that night, and although I
was surprised to find myself the first and Lord John not
there, I sat down to wait and fell asleep. I had had a
hard day. I only condescend to explain,” she continued
witheringly, “because you are as venomous as a mad dog
and it is as well to muzzle you at once.”</p>

<p>“I don’t believe a word of that yarn, and neither will
anyone else. I certainly managed to convince Mrs.
Blake——”</p>

<p>“Not she. She must have laughed in your face——”</p>

<p>“Oh no! Not Mrs. Blake! But I will admit that it was
not easy to make her believe ill of you. Perhaps I should
not have succeeded, but when a woman is eager to believe——”
He laughed and shrugged his shoulders; but
once more he cast a quick glance at the line of retreat.
The heavy library table was between them.</p>

<p>“What the devil do you mean?” Ida spoke roughly, but
her heart began to hammer. She felt a sudden impulse to
run away, but she stood rigidly and glared at him.
“Here!” she continued, “come to the point. Spit out
your poison. What particular object had you in trying to
set my best friend against me? It would have been more
like you to run to a newspaper.”</p>

<p>“That later. I wanted to do Mrs. Blake a good turn
and at the same time let her be the one to tell your husband
that he could secure his freedom without further
delay——”</p>

<p>“What do you mean? What do you mean?” Ida’s
eyes were staring as if they saw a vision of herself at the
stake; she tossed off her pride as she would a hampering
cloak. “Ora! Ora! Oh, not Ora! You liar!” she
screamed. “Prove what you said quick——” But he saw
that she had caught the edge of the table and that her
body was swaying.</p>

<p>“Oh, neither will deny it now,” he replied in a tone of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_353">[353]</span>
deadly quiet. “She went out there to be near him, no
doubt of that; and he’s spent hours on end in that bungalow.
I went to Helena and back with him and I guessed
that something was up, for he was glummer and more
disagreeable than usual; and this afternoon when I saw
her come up out of his mine I guessed they had had a
painful scene and parted. So I told her she had the
game in her own hands, and that I’d go on the stand and
swear to what I saw. No husband would believe anything
but the truth, nor this town either. You might prove
that your lord made a fool of you and amused himself
elsewhere, but you’re done for all the same; and I guess
Mr. Compton would manage his divorce all right. Then
two people that are madly in love will be happy——”</p>

<p>Ida’s strength rushed back and the world turned scarlet.
She picked up a heavy bronze from the table and hurled
it at him. But Whalen was expecting a physical assault
in some form. He ducked and fled. When she reached
the open door he was not in sight.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">ORA watched the clock until twenty minutes after eleven.</p>

<p>The miners changed shift promptly, and the last
should have gone down the Primo shaft by a quarter past
at the latest. The shaft house would be empty, as no hoisting
was being done on the night shift.</p>

<p>She turned out the light in her living-room, wrapped
herself in a dark lodenmantel, a long cape with a hood
that she had worn while climbing in Bavaria, and let herself
out. She walked through the grove to the edge of the
bluff above her camp and stood for a few moments, listening
intently. Some ten minutes since she had heard the
warning shriek of an automobile horn, but the garage of
her manager, who had motored Whalen into Butte, was
on the flat, and he had had time either to go down into
the mine or climb to his own cottage.</p>

<p>The moon was at the full and the scene as sharply outlined
as by day, although less animated. Save for the
usual raucous noises of a mining camp the only sign of
life was in the saloon. Some one was playing a pianola,
and through the open door she saw men standing at the
bar. For a moment she was tempted to take the surface
path across the camps; but the risk was too great. Some
one was sure to be abroad, and although she had been willing
to brave the scorn of the world when there was no
apparent alternative, she shrank from the plain Saxon the
miners would use if they saw her. From Gregory’s shaft
house she could reach his cabin by the path behind the
abandoned cut.</p>

<p>A light was burning in her shaft house. She was not
expert enough to descend the ladder candle in hand, and
for a moment faltered above the darkness of the well; she
had not been down before at night. Then she reflected that
it was always night in the mines and descended without
further hesitation.</p>

<p>At the foot of the shaft the usual station was one with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_355">[355]</span>
the chamber left after removing the first large deposit of
ore. They had merely cut through the vein at this point
without stoping, and the great excavation had a lofty
roof. Ora struck a match and lit a candle near by. On
the day of the geologists’ visit a number of miner’s candlesticks
had been thrust into what little wood there was in
the chamber, and the candles were but half burnt out.
Then she lit the one she had brought in her pocket. Accustomed
as she was by this time to the route underground
by chamber and gallery to the Perch mine, she always
picked her way carefully, particularly down the first drift;
her lessees, impatient at the leanness of the connecting
vein, and not wishing to spend either the time or the money
to sink the shaft another hundred feet, had understoped,
and the holes were ill-covered.</p>

<p>She crossed the large black cavern toward the first of
these tunnels, or drifts, sweeping the candle about her
head, and then holding it downward, for she always
feared cave-ins. The room was almost untimbered, owing
to the hardness of the rock.</p>

<p>She had almost reached the mouth of the drift, when
she paused suddenly, listened intently, and then blew out
her candle. Some one was on the ladder. It was one of
the miners, no doubt. Something had detained him above
ground, and not daring to summon the shaft house man,
he was sneaking down the ladder. He would go on down
to the second level of the mine. Ora stood motionless, her
hood pulled over her white face. Her miners were good
average men, but the saloon flourished, and was no doubt
responsible for the present delinquency.</p>

<p>Then once more she listened intently. The upper part
of her body stiffened like a startled animal’s. Whoever
was coming down was making his first descent by foot; not
only was his progress slow, but he was breathing heavily,
and hesitating between rungs, as if it were his first experience
of an inclined ladder. Miners hate the shaft ladder,
and will resort to any subterfuge to avoid it, but they are
experts in “negotiating” it nevertheless. No doubt this
was some green hand, recently employed. Or possibly the
man was drunk.</p>

<p>Then suddenly Ora turned cold with the chill of the
mine itself, a mere physical attribute that her warm blood
had never deigned to notice before. A form was slowly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_356">[356]</span>
coming into view below the high roof of the cavern, and
although it was little more than a blot on the general
blackness, Ora’s keen eyes, accustomed to the faint relief
given by the candle near the shaft, noted as it descended
further that it covered more of the ladder than it should.
Miners are almost invariably thin and they wear overalls.
This person wore a heavy cape like her own. But it was
not alone the garment, which any miner would scorn, that
betrayed the sex of the invader; it may have been the
physical awkwardness, the shallow breathing, or some
subtle psychical emanation—or all—that warned Ora of
the approach not only of a woman but of a malignant force.</p>

<p>And this woman was following her. There was no doubt
in her mind of that. She suffered a moment or two of
furious unreasoning terror as she crouched against the wall
and watched that shadow against a shadow slowly descend
the final rungs of the ladder. Her first impulse had been
to flee down the drift, but there was danger of falling into
one of the gouge holes and disabling herself. She dared
not relight her candle.</p>

<p>Shaking, terrified as she never had been in her life—for
she was normally brave, and it was not a normal woman
she feared but that aura of hate and lust for vengeance—undecided,
putting up a frantic prayer that Gregory would
come to her rescue, she pulled the hood over her face and
almost sank to her knees. The woman, breathing heavily,
reached the last rung and touched the ground as warily
as a cat. For a moment she stood drawing in deep breaths
like sighs, but which escaped, to tormented ears, like a hiss.
Ora, her eyelids almost meeting over the intense concentration
of her gaze, saw the woman fling back the mantle that
covered her, throw out her arms as if to relax the muscles
after the strain of the descent. Then she turned suddenly,
snatched the candlestick from the wall and held it
above her head.</p>

<p>For the moment Ora thought her heart had stopped.
The woman was Ida. Her heavy lowered brows were like
a heavy band across the white ghastliness of her face. Her
eyes glittered horribly. Her lips were a mere tight line.
Her black hair, loosened, fell over her face. Ora’s hypnotised
gaze tore itself from those slowly moving eyes and
lowered itself instinctively to Ida’s right hand. It held
the stiletto she had given her in Genoa. The slanting rays<span class="pagenum" id="Page_357">[357]</span>
of the candle fell on the jewels of the hilt. Then she knew
that Ida had followed her down into the mine to kill her.</p>

<p>Her courage came back as quickly as it had fled. Ora’s
brain might be democratic but her soul was haughty.
The friendship of the past eighteen months between herself
and this woman suddenly shaped itself as forced and artificial,
and she was filled with a cold surprise and anger.
<i>Who</i> was Ida Hook that she should presume to question
Ora Stratton? Similar reflections, no doubt, stiffened many
a noble when on his way to the guillotine at the behest
of the <i>canaille</i>.</p>

<p>Ora was beyond the ray of the candle at present but
Ida was beginning to move forward, her eyes almost blank
in spite of their brilliancy, moving from side to side, striving
to pierce the darkness, her head bent forward to catch
the slightest sound. It was evident that she had seen Ora
go into the shaft house, and knew that she could not be
far off.</p>

<p>Ora took the automatic from the bag at her waist,
pointed it at the roof of the cave and fired twice. The din
was terrific in that confined space. Ida shrieked, dropped
the stiletto and candle, and flung her arms about her head.
Ora hastily lighted two other candles, and then retreated
against the wall. She believed that the terrible inhibition
in Ida’s tormented mind was shattered, but she kept the
automatic in her hand, nevertheless.</p>

<p>The reverberations died away and once more the mine
was as silent as only a deserted level of a mine can be.
Ida raised her head and saw Ora. She gave a strangled
cry and moved forward a step. Then her arms fell heavily
to her side. She did not even pick up the dagger. The
inhuman tension of her mind relaxed, the body barely had
force enough to hold itself together.</p>

<p>“I came here to kill you,” she said. “But I can’t do
it. I’ve been mad for hours, and I wish I could have
found you in bed as I thought I would. I could have
killed you then. But I saw you come down here—Have
you told him?”</p>

<p>“No. He was down in the mine until eleven. I was on
my way to tell him—to break down his resistance tonight!”</p>

<p>“His resistance?” Ida raised her head. She had lost
the pitch necessary for murder, but her mind began to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_358">[358]</span>
recover its alertness and her drooping body to set its
springs in motion. “What do you mean by that? I
thought he was in love with you.”</p>

<p>Ora laughed. She was filled with an utter despair, but
the knife was still in Ida and she could turn it round.
“Oh, yes, make no doubt of that. He loves me and will
as long as he lives——”</p>

<p>“Not much he won’t!” roared Ida. “If I’ve been too
quick for you you’ll never tell him now, and he practically
gave me his word the other day that he’d never even ask
me for a divorce again. That means you go and go quick,
and if you think Gregory will have nothing to do but sit
down and nurse your memory——”</p>

<p>The blood flew to Ora’s head and she hastily dropped
the automatic into her bag. “I’ll not go!” she said. “And
what is more I shall tell him. When Gregory knows that
you spent three hours in Mowbray’s rooms at night——”</p>

<p>“Mowbray was not there! He was at the Country
Club——”</p>

<p>“<i>Was</i> he?”</p>

<p>“Yes, and it can be proved. Moreover, you know me
well enough——”</p>

<p>“It doesn’t matter what can be proved or what I believe.
You waited for Mowbray—Do you suppose that Gregory—or
any court of law——”</p>

<p>“My God!” cried Ida. “You! You! I think it was
that drove me off my head more than the prospect of disgrace
and losing Gregory. You! What in God’s name is
possessing you? I always knew that you would be the concentrated
essence of all damn fool women that ever lived
when you did fall in love, but I never believed it was in
you to do anything dishonourable——”</p>

<p>“And would you have believed that you, the concentrated
essence of all that is cool, deliberate, calculating,
would ever be inspired to commit murder? And for a
man? What’s the use of talking? People possessed by love
either are wholly themselves while it lasts, or are abnormal
and should not be held accountable even to the law. I
suppose this means that you too love Gregory Compton?”</p>

<p>“Yes it does!” cried Ida, the more vehemently because
it shamed her to put this unwonted weakness into words.
“I do, damn it all! I do. I thought I was immune, but I
guess we are all born with the microbe and it bites when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_359">[359]</span>
the soil is good and ready.” Her anger had vanished, for
in spite of Ora’s defiance she knew that she was master of
the situation. She kicked the stiletto contemptuously aside,
clasped her hips with her large firm hands and threw
back her shoulders. “Now!” she said, “admit right here
that you know I didn’t go to Mowbray’s rooms for any old
intrigue. That kind of thing isn’t in me and you know
it.”</p>

<p>“I will confess I was surprised—I refused to believe it
at first—Oh, I suppose I don’t. But it doesn’t matter——”</p>

<p>“Are you ready to come with me this minute to Gregory
and tell him that yarn—knowing that I can prove Mowbray
wasn’t there—I say <i>go with me</i>—not by yourself.”</p>

<p>Ora made no reply. She was beaten but she was not
ready to admit it.</p>

<p>“You may bet your life on one thing,” continued Ida.
“You go with me or you don’t go at all, for I’ll stick to you
like wet paint until this thing is settled once for all. Now
just tell me what you meant a while back by Gregory’s
resistance? When you found I wouldn’t consent to a divorce—of
course you put him up to ask me, you traitorous
little white devil—did you want him to elope with
you?”</p>

<p>“Yes I did!”</p>

<p>“And he wouldn’t!”</p>

<p>“He—he would not sacrifice me——”</p>

<p>“Shucks! Where did you want him to go? To Europe?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Good Lord! And what did you think you were going
to do with him over there? Spoon in orange groves for
forty years?”</p>

<p>“There are several thousand resources in Europe besides
orange groves—but you would never understand——”</p>

<p>“Oh, don’t I understand? It’s I that does understand,
not you, or you would never have made such an asinine
proposition to Gregory Compton. Why on earth didn’t
you propose some place with <i>mines</i>—Mexico, Alaska,
China—Then you might have stood some show—but Europe—Gregory—Do
you remember those American business
men that always looked as if they had left their
minds in an office at the top of a thirty-story building, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_360">[360]</span>
their bodies were being led round by a string? The vision
of Gregory astray in Europe for the rest of his life would
be funny if it weren’t so pathetic. Talk about the conceit
of man. It isn’t a patch on that of a woman when she gets
the bug inside her head that she can be ‘everything’ to a
man. I can manage Gregory till doomsday when I get
him back, but you’d lose him inside of six months no matter
which way you got him——”</p>

<p>“That couldn’t be true! I recognised that he was mine—<i>mine</i>—the
night we met before I left——”</p>

<p>“What’s that?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, I met him once before I went abroad with
you—we talked for an hour——”</p>

<p>“And he was the man you wrote those letters to in
Europe——”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“And I your most intimate friend!”</p>

<p>“I never sent them, and you did not care for him
then——”</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t see you apologising if you had turned
heaven into hell. You made up your mind then to have
him, I suppose?”</p>

<p>“No. And not even when I came out here. I only
wanted to be with him—know him a little better—have
that much—Oh, I couldn’t make you understand any more
than that I can suffer as much as if I were the best
of women who had lost her husband by death. It
was only after Mowbray came—there seemed a prospect——”</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t know that I blame you so much, for I
certainly bluffed it pretty well. I can forgive you for that
but not for meaning to make me out a strumpet and send
me to the muck heap, disgraced for the rest of my life.
Well, come along. Let us go straight to Gregory and let
him decide.”</p>

<p>Ora did not move.</p>

<p>“It’s either that or you go back to Butte with me tonight
and start for Europe tomorrow morning.”</p>

<p>“I know when I am beaten. I will leave. And don’t
imagine that you have won because you are in the right.
We have emerged from the dark ages of superstition, and
we know that the wicked are not punished if they are
strong enough. Nor are the virtuous rewarded for mere<span class="pagenum" id="Page_361">[361]</span>
virtue—not once in ten thousand times. You have won
because you are stronger than I. That is all.”</p>

<p>“It’s enough for me.”</p>

<p>Ora laughed. “Do you really believe that you can win
him back? He’ll not forget me, because I can always fire
his imagination. He is as indifferent to you as only a
man can be when the woman is an old story.”</p>

<p>“That was a nasty one! But I’m not worrying. I have
been at a disadvantage since I got back, thinking my only
rival was a hole in the ground. But take this from me,
Ora: when a woman knows where she stands, and has the
inside track, and has her nerve with her, the man has
no show whatever. Nor the other woman. I’ll get him
back all right. And he’ll forget you. That’s a man’s
long suit.”</p>

<p>“We’ll neither of us ever know, so it doesn’t matter.
I shall never see him again. That is all that matters to
me.”</p>

<p>“And Valdobia?”</p>

<p>“I shall marry him. I suppose—after a while.”</p>

<p>“I don’t mind saying that he is much too good for
you.”</p>

<p>“Possibly. And he’ll love me the more.”</p>

<p>“And shall you tell him of this little interlude?”</p>

<p>“Certainly not.”</p>

<p>“Well, I always have maintained that the woman who
confessed anything to a man was a fool, but it certainly is
a queer mix up.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know that I should so much mind telling him,
after all. Men are too practical to resent any but the
literal infidelity. And he is the only person living that
understands me. Gregory does not and never would care
to. Why could not I have had this madness for the one
man who is really fitted to be my mate—whose ideas of
life are my own, who has so much the same order of
mind? Why should I love Gregory Compton, a man I
not only cannot marry, but with whom I never could find
a real companionship. My God! Why? Why?”</p>

<p>“There are several ways of getting ahead of life,” said
Ida drily, “and one is not asking ‘Why’ too often. That’s
just one of her little traps to keep you discontented. You
and Gregory Compton! It certainly is funny. What did
you talk about anyway?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_362">[362]</span>Ora threw out her arms and laughed wildly. “Ores.
Ores. Ores. I tried to interest him in many of the things
that interested me. He didn’t even try to understand
what I was driving at. One night I offered to read to
him—I had a lively new volume of memoirs in mind—he
asked if I had any work on copper. I read to him for
three hours from a book called ‘The Copper Mines of
the World,’ technicalities and all. Of course he had read
it before, but it seemed to delight him. We literally had
no common meeting ground but ores, but we loved each
other madly. Oh, don’t tell me that it was mere passion!”
she broke out as angrily as if Ida had interrupted
her. “Valdobia is attractive in far more ways and better
looking. Gregory has met many women.—If that were
all we should have bored each other long since—we never
could have held each other’s imaginations while apart.—I
tell you it is some deep primary bond—something that
older races perhaps could explain. Why should we meet
at all in this life——”</p>

<p>“I guess when we understand all the different brands
of love we’ll vaccinate and be immune. Shut your teeth,
Ora, and take your medicine. And for heaven’s sake let
us get out of this damp hole. I’ll help you and Custer
pack and we’ll go to Butte in the car I came out in. Have
I got to go up that ladder!”</p>

<p>“No, we’ll go over to the Perch mine and ring for the
skip there. My engineer is not on duty during the ‘graveyard
shift.’”</p>

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_363">[363]</span>

<h3 class="nobreak">XXV</h3>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">ON the following morning Ida, having seen Ora on the
train bound for Chicago, went at once to a public
garage, rented the touring car she had used the night
before, and was driven out to the mines. She walked up
to the cabin on the crest of Perch of the Devil and, finding
it empty, summoned a miner who was lounging near and
bade him call Mr. Compton. The man asked to be allowed
to use the telephone in the office, obtained connection with
the second level of the mine, and announced in a few
moments that the boss was on his way up.</p>

<p>Ida, who had dropped wearily into a chair, merely
nodded as Gregory entered. He was as pale as a dark
man can be, and his voice when he spoke sounded as if
he had been running.</p>

<p>“What is it?” he demanded. “Has anything happened——”</p>

<p>“To Ora? Nothing, except that she is on her way East
and to Europe. Tired, no doubt, but quite well.”</p>

<p>Gregory drew a short sigh of relief, and sat down before
his table, shading his eyes with his hand. “Well?” he
asked. “What is it?”</p>

<p>“I haven’t come out here to make a scene, or even to
reproach you. I believe that I should have the self-restraint
to ignore the subject altogether if it were not
for that man, Whalen. Some one must put an extinguisher
on him at once and you are the one to do it. That is why
I am obliged to tell you that I found out yesterday about
you and Ora. I had begun to believe there must be some
woman in the case but I had not the least suspicion of
Ora. I not only believed her to be the soul of honour, but
I thought she was really in love with the Marchese Valdobia,
a Roman who has everything to offer that a woman
of her type demands, and to marry whom she had demanded
a divorce from Mark. She has been tacitly engaged
to him ever since we left Europe.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_364">[364]</span>Ida saw the muscles in Gregory’s long body stiffen as
if he were about to spring, and his eyes glitter through
the lattice of his fingers. But he made no comment, and
after giving him time to assimilate her information, she
added more gently:</p>

<p>“Console yourself with the reflection that she would
have thrown him over for you. But she knows now what
a mistake she would have made. Ora is one of those atavistic
Americans that are far more at home in Europe
than in the new world. She has gone where she belongs
and Valdobia is her man.”</p>

<p>She paused again. He was still silent, and she continued
less fluently: “Now I come to the unpleasant part for myself.
To begin at the beginning: I made an enemy of
little Whalen before I went abroad. He had the sublime
impudence to kiss me one day, and I simply took him by
the back of his neck and the seat of his pants and threw
him out of the window. He has had it in for me ever
since.”</p>

<p>In spite of the various emotions raging within him,
Gregory laughed aloud at the picture. The atmosphere
felt clearer. Ida went on with more confidence:</p>

<p>“Of course you know that Lord John Mowbray followed
me here. He wanted me to get a divorce and marry him,
as Valdobia had planned with Ora. I liked him well
enough, but even if I had been free it never would have
occurred to me to marry him, and no one knew better
than he that I didn’t care a copper cent for him. His
hope after he came here—a hope in which he was encouraged
by Ora—was that, as you were so loudly indifferent,
pride might drive me to leave you and make a brilliant
marriage. Well, I was tempted for a moment. It was on
the night of the day I had been down in the mine with
you. I believed that I had given myself away absolutely,
offered myself and been refused as casually as if I had
been some woman of the streets; told you almost in so
many words that I loved you and been invited with excruciating
politeness to go to the devil.</p>

<p>“Well, that night I nearly went off my head. I had a
whole mind, for a few moments, to ring up Mowbray and
tell him that I would get my freedom and leave the country
for ever. But that passed. I couldn’t have done it,
and I knew it, in spite of the blood pumping in my head.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_365">[365]</span>
I went out for a walk, for I had smashed a few things
already. Then the mad impulse came to me to call on
Mowbray. I knew that I’d treat him no better than I
had treated Whalen if he so much as tried to kiss me. But
I wasn’t afraid. He was too keen on marrying me to take
any risks. What I wanted was to do something real
devilish—to be more elegant, something quite the antithesis
of all that is <i>comme il faut</i>. So I went. Mowbray
wasn’t there. He had gone to the dance at the Country
Club. I sat down to wait for him and fell asleep. When
I awoke it was after one o’clock and I was still alone. I can
tell you I got out pretty quick. I had slept the blood out
of my head and I felt like a fool. I bribed the Jap not
to tell Mowbray or anyone else.</p>

<p>“Well, the point of all this is—and the only reason I
have told you—Whalen saw me go in and waited for me
to come out. He believed that he had found his chance
for revenge at last. No doubt he would have told you on
the way to Helena, but he hasn’t the spunk of a road
agent at the wrong end of a gun. So he took his tale to
Ora when he got back.—But before I go any further
I want you to say that you believe I had no wrong
motive in going to Mowbray’s rooms. Of course a hundred
people could testify that he did not leave the Country
Club until three o’clock, but that is not the point with
you.”</p>

<p>“I believe you,” said Gregory. He was intensely interested.</p>

<p>Ida drew a long sigh and the colour came back to her
face. Her eyes, heavy with fatigue, sparkled. “Well!
Whalen was all for drinking his cup of revenge down to
the dregs. It wasn’t enough to spring a mine under me,
he must see what I looked like when it blew up the first
time. After he told Ora he posted into Butte and managed
to get into my house unannounced—that maid has
been fired. I was in the library on the other side of the
room. The doorway was good enough for him. He told
me. Some time I’ll tell you all I felt. After he had lit
out with the Venus of Milo flying after him, I went stark
mad. I made up what mind I had left to kill Ora and kill
her quick.”</p>

<p>“What?” Gregory sat up and stared at her, his eyes
wide open. And, astounded as he was, the immortal vanity<span class="pagenum" id="Page_366">[366]</span>
of man thrilled responsively to the reckless and destructive
passions he had inspired in these two remarkable
women.</p>

<p>“I got a touring car and arrived at the foot of her hill—a
little after eleven it was, I guess. There was a light in
her living-room, and I made up my mind to wait until I
was sure she was alone and in her bedroom. Then I
intended to get in somehow or other and kill her with that
stiletto she gave me in Genoa. It was a notion of hers that
I had been one of the wicked dames of the Renaissance,
and I just naturally took the hint. While I was waiting
the light went out and almost immediately I saw her hurry
down the path that led to her claim and go into her shaft
house. I knew on the instant that she was going to you,
and that she took that route to avoid being seen. My
mind could grasp that much in spite of the fixed idea in
it—that she was on her way to tell you Whalen’s story.
This was true as I found out afterwards. She went that
night, partly because she couldn’t keep it any longer,
partly because she wanted to tell you when you were alone
in your cabin at night and she could also bind you hand
and foot with that Lorelei hair of hers. It takes the hyper-civilised
super-refined Oras to stick at nothing when their
primitive instincts loosen up.</p>

<p>“Well—I went into the shaft house, and listened until
I no longer could hear her on the ladder. Then I followed.
Glory! Shall I ever forget going down that ladder?
I felt as if every muscle in my body were being
torn up by the roots; and I had to carry the stiletto
between my teeth. And pitch dark. All my clothes in
the way every step. It was enough to take the starch out
of tragedy, and I guess it would have flattened me out if
it hadn’t been just the one thing that could make me madder
still.</p>

<p>“I’ll give you the details of that scene some other time.
I’m too tired now. It is enough to say that she had a
pistol and made such an infernal racket with it—shooting
at the roof—that something busted in my head and I
came to. Then we had it out. She agreed to leave because
she knew me too well to believe I had gone to Mowbray’s
rooms for any horrid purpose, and he hadn’t been there
anyway. I told her that if she told you it would have to
be before me, and she knew that she couldn’t brazen it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_367">[367]</span>
through. So I packed her and got her off this morning.
That means that I had no sleep last night.”</p>

<p>She stood up and Gregory rose also. “Now, there are
two things more,” she said with no lack of decision in her
voice, whatever her fatigue of body. “You must settle
Whalen, and you must move to Butte and live in my house,
even if you are only there once or twice a week. Whalen,
the moment he discovers that Ora has gone, will run about
Butte defaming me, or carry the story to the papers. It
wouldn’t do me much good to prove that Mowbray wasn’t
there. People like to believe the worst, and in time would
forget that Mowbray had been at the Club on that particular
night. My set might be all right. But the rest—and
my servants—and Ruby and Pearl! They always
use the word ‘bad,’ and, as Ora says, an intrigue is only
decent in a foreign language. It gives me the horrors to
think of it. But if we are seen together twice a week, and
you are known to be living in the house, however often
you must be absent, nobody will listen to a story that is
not headed toward the divorce court.”</p>

<p>“I’ll buy Whalen’s claim and tell him to get out of
Montana. He’ll go! As for the rest of your programme—please
be sure, Ida, that I stand ready to protect you now
and always. You are not only my wife but an extraordinary
woman, and I am very proud of you.”</p>

<p>“Oh, the extraordinary woman hasn’t been born yet, in
spite of the big fight the sex is putting up,” said Ida
lightly, as they left the cabin and walked down the hill.
“When women really are extraordinary they will be just
as happy without men as they now want to be with them.
They try with all their might to be hard, and they can ring
outside like metal, but inside they are just one perpetual
shriek for the right man to come along—that is all but a
few hundred thousand tribadists. But they’ve made a
beginning, and one day they’ll really be able to take men
as incidentally as men take women. Then we’ll all be
happy. Don’t you fool yourself that that’s what I’m
aiming at, though. I’m the sort that hangs on to her man
like grim death.”</p>

<p>“You’re all right!” said Gregory, who, man-like, was
automatically readjusting himself to the inevitable.</p>

<p>He handed her into the tonneau of the car, and tucked
the robe about her. She gave his hand a hearty friendly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_368">[368]</span>
shake, for she was much too wise and too tired for sentiment.
“Don’t you worry about Ora,” she said. “Custer
is with her and she has the drawing-room, and is probably
sound asleep at this moment. It must be very restful to
get a tragic love affair off your chest.”</p>

<p>And then the car rolled off and she fell asleep at once.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">THEY stood together in the dawn, the blue dawn of
Montana. Silver stars were winking dimly in the
silver sky, clear save above the glittering peaks of the
distant range, which reflected the blue of a bank of clouds
above. And all the vast and snowy expanse was blue; and
the snow on the pine trees of the forest.</p>

<p>No one stirred in the two camps, not abroad at least;
and even the shacks and larger buildings built with as
little regard for beauty were transformed and glorified
by the white splendour of winter. On the crest of Perch
of the Devil was a long gracefully built bungalow, also
heavily laden with snow, and between the posts of its
verandah hung icicles, iridescent blue in the dawn.</p>

<p>A small lawn had been cultivated, and they leaned over
the gate of the fence that surrounded it, not wrapped in
one buffalo robe, but in heavy automobile coats, their
heads protected from the intense cold by fur caps. But
they stood close together, and even a passing stranger
would have known that there was harmony between them.
Both were looking at the cold loveliness of the dawn and
admiring it subconsciously, and both were thinking of
other things. Gregory was visualising a ranch he had
bought not long since near those mountains, and the wire
gold but a few feet below the surface, found a fortnight
ago while ditching. He had his gold mine at last, but it
merely would hasten his grooming for the millionaire
brotherhood, and had given him none of the exultant
ecstasy he had dreamed of in the days before he had
opened Perch of the Devil. The gold mine was not in his
hill! Only the sharp, cool, calculating business wing of
his brain appreciated it. The mine beneath his feet was
still the object of his deep affections.</p>

<p>And sometimes, down in the depths of that mine (never
above ground), he sat alone for a few moments and thought
of Ora. He had forced her out of his mind when she went<span class="pagenum" id="Page_372">[372]</span>
out of his life, but nothing could dislodge her from his
ivory tower, although in time to come she might gather
dust for years on end. For months after she married Valdobia
she seemed to have taken his memory to Rome with
her; but she brought it back in time.</p>

<p>In those rare moments when he peered through the windows
of that inner temple, he, too, sometimes asked,
“Why?” What had it all meant? It had been perfect
love—yet so lamentably imperfect; not only because they
were torn apart, but because they would not have found
permanent happiness together. Between some subtle essence
of their beings there was an indissoluble bond, but
their minds were not in accord, and neither would have
been adaptable save during that fluid period when even
strong egos lose their bearings and float on that inevitable
sea of many tides called Love; knowing that when it casts
them on the shore whence they came, once more will they
be as malleable as rock crystal. But what had it all meant?</p>

<p>And his wife made him very happy. He found her
increasingly desirable as a life companion. She adapted
herself to every angle of his character while losing none
of her own picturesque individuality; made no impossible
exactions either on his soul or his time; was always beautiful
to look at; and the most level-headed of his friends.</p>

<p>Even men of less complicated egos have been able to
love two women at once and survive.</p>

<p>And Ida? She at least had what she wanted, she was
a philosopher, and therefore as happy as may be. By
constant manœuvring she saw more of her busy husband
than falls to the lot of most American wives married to
too successful men. She had made herself so necessary
to him that he returned from his many absences almost as
eager to see her as his mine. On these hurried trips she
never accompanied him, not only because it was wise to
let him miss her, and to think of her always in the home
setting, but because they gave her the opportunity to
retain her hold on Butte; to enjoy her beautiful house
there and her many friends.</p>

<p>Suddenly Gregory raised his head. Then he lifted the
ear flap of his fur cap. High above there was a loud humming,
as of the wind along telegraph wires, or the droning
of many bees, or the strumming of an aerial harp. The
month was March and the weather forty degrees below<span class="pagenum" id="Page_373">[373]</span>
zero. The very sky, whose silver was growing dim, looked
frosted, but a moment later Gregory felt a warm puff of
air on his cheek.</p>

<p>“The Chinook!” he said softly.</p>

<p>Another puff touched them both lightly, then a long
wave of warm air swept down and about them.</p>

<p>“It’s chinooking, certainly,” said Ida, opening her fur
coat and pushing back her cap. “I hope that means we’ve
had the last of winter.”</p>

<p>Again there was a long diving wave, almost hot in its
contrast to the cold air rising from the ground, and still
accompanied by that humming orchestra above. But in a
few moments the hum had deepened into a roar down in
the tree tops and about the corners of the buildings on the
hill. The icicles fell from the eaves and lay shattered and
dissolving on the porch, the snow was blown up in frosty
clouds and melted as it fell.</p>

<p>“It’s the last of winter, I guess,” said Gregory. “We’re
not likely to have another long spell of cold. Spring has
come. And so has daylight. Let’s go in, old girl.”</p>

displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when

</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
